Natalia works at a small medical office that provides pediatric care. She is the only person providing IT support to the employees of the office. No two days in her work week are similar. Today, her morning started with helping the receptionist retrieve a lost patient appointment. Then she moved on to investigating why the printer in one of the physicians' offices was not working. The medical office wants to optimize operations by eliminating paper documentation. Natalia spent the afternoon looking into software products for keeping electronic patient records. While working on the product comparison, she got a call that the billing claims queue was growing large, which indicated issues in data exchange between the office systems and the insurance agencies. The variety of tasks Natalia performs means that she must have a broad scope of knowledge.

Jace, on the other hand, works at a large IT organization that provides cloud solutions to clients. He specializes in architecting solutions that support mobile apps for banking. The projects he works on are highly specialized. He is able to provide clients with optimal solutions that meet the needs of their mobile app users.

While many companies provide third-party IT services, most IT professionals work in small- to medium-size organizations and provide a wide range of support to businesses, their employees, and their clients. Companies elect to use in-house IT departments or to use third-party providers for specific IT functions. Even when most of the IT functions are provided by vendors, companies usually keep a small team of IT professionals to manage the vendors and ensure the organization’s infrastructure and technology adequately support the organization’s processes.</div>

Identify major IT roles and functions.

Today, organizations expect to hire IT graduates who have not only been trained on current technologies but also understand all aspects of IT infrastructure, including theoretical issues, the mathematics of computers (binary), the roles of various computer components, programming techniques, database operations, networks, the internet, and perhaps specialized issues such as computer forensics. Most higher education programs in IT comprise a core of coursework that includes IT systems, operating systems, networking, security, scripting and programming, data management, project management, and web development.

IT programs build on the common core of IT knowledge by offering curricula for their major area. For example, a Bachelor of Science in Software Development likely includes courses in programming languages that include scripting languages such as Linux/Unix shell scripting, Ruby or Python, and JavaScript and compiled languages such as C, C++, Java, or Visual Basic.</div>

Differentiate between information and data.
Describe characteristics of valuable data.

Seamus Bank is looking for ways to better serve account holders. Customer surveys show customers' preference for managing their accounts whenever they like without having to visit a branch of the bank. The organization’s leadership would like the IT department to develop a mobile banking app. The IT department is looking at development platforms as well as a variety of cloud-based options to support the data and connectivity of the mobile app and to develop a web portal for the clients. As the app will manage data on financial transactions, the project needs systems that store the data from the mobile app activities, integrate with the bank’s database systems, and ensure accurate and secure data exchange.

Data aggregates with incredible speed and in amounts that are hard to understand. With our activities and interactions, at home or at work, while taking selfies or writing emails, we all contribute to the massive aggregates of data. For this data to be useful, we must make sense of it and make connections we might not have been aware of. We, as humans, are not fast enough to generate insights from all that data. This is precisely why we rely on scientific methods and approaches that give us a reasonable view that valuable insights may be revealed.

The Data Pyramid

Information is defined in terms of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The data pyramid is a concept that visualizes the data-information-knowledge-wisdom hierarchy.

Figure: DIKW Pyramid
A pyramid with the top block labeled Wisdom, followed by Knowledge, Information, and the bottom layer labeled Data.

Information is a collection of processed data from a variety of sources. Data is continually aggregating and is not useful until it has been processed and is presented in a usable form. Data includes raw facts or observations.

Once data is organized, information can be inferred. Asking the questions why, who, what, where, and how allows us to use the data in a meaningful way and support decisions.

Information can be structured or unstructured, and the key term associated with it is meaning.

Knowledge is hard to define. A more frequently used definition is the following:

Knowledge is a dynamic combination of experience, values, contextual information, expert insight, and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In organizations, it often becomes embedded not only in documents and repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices, and norms.

The key term associated with knowledge is context.

Wisdom is knowing the right thing to do.

Connectedness Wisdom
Figure. Example of the connectedness wisdom understanding principles.
Graph depicting the relationship between the data pyramid with connectedness and understanding.

Connectedness wisdom is essentially “the path to connected understanding” when interpreting data. It is that human element leveraging an intelligent technology component when attempting to make fact-based decisions.

This graph depicts the path that leads from data to information, information to knowledge, and knowledge to wisdom.

Consider the following example.

Facts gathered from observations or from a clock that measures time are examples of data. For example, when a clock reads "18:30," it is providing data. Likewise, when we observe something is "on" or "off," we are observing data. When put in context, this data provides information. When we know that "18:30" is a time reference to 6:30 p.m., and when we observe the switch as "on," it provides us with a status indicating the appliance or item is turned on.

Look around the room you are in and put the information in context. Interpreted in context, a statement of knowledge may be the following: “The room I am working in is getting dark.” Knowing to turn the light switch on is now the right thing to do as a result of the data we have observed.

Flipped Pyramid
Figure. The Data Pyramid as it relates to Big Data.
Diagram: Big Data and the Data Pyramid
The data pyramid is inverted with data (the base) on top and wisdom (the apex) on the bottom. Beneath it is a correctly oriented pyramid shape labeled "big data." Next to the pyramids are some descriptions of the types of data typically found at each level of the diagram. Data is described as "raw data." Information is described as "data with basic context." Knowledge is described as "data with business context or function." Wisdom is described as "understanding the question - business context, function, and related information." The lower, correctly oriented pyramid labeled "big data" is described as "smart data - trusted source for business decisions." Beneath the graph is a statement that reads "Data Science: Finding patterns/clusters in information; providing insight where one would not know to look for it."

We might be part of an organization gathering customer information on purchasing habits. We gather data that captures which customer bought which product, how much they paid, their method of payment, and their address. We store this data somewhere, typically in the organization’s data centers or in the cloud. The data is associated with the attributes of a sale. Information comes from knowing which data is the customer name and which is the method of payment, etc.

At the level of information, we can apply a variety of tools to help support decision-making, and they relate to the past. We can calculate the average amount spent by customers or generate a list of those that shop with the organization frequently. This information can be used to figure out how our customers behave and give us the wisdom to preemptively replenish our warehouses to be able to meet anticipated customer needs. We certainly do not want to be overstocked, as inventory is expensive, nor understocked, as that negatively impacts customer retention and experience.

Big data and data science take us from seeing and learning from the past and present to looking at the future. We typically work within the pyramid knowing about the possible dynamics in the business and try to discover parameters of a dynamic that we are aware of. With data science we discover connections that we might not have imagined exist. For example, do you ever wonder why golfing magazines are full of advertisements for investing services? Observing customer features and behaviors has discovered a link between golf and affluence. The more affluent an individual, the more likely they are to play golf.</div>

Describe characteristics of valuable data.
Differentiate between information and data.
Differentiate between input, output, and storage.
Explain the importance of ensuring that data and information systems support business goals and processes.

Data helps us make decisions. It is a misconception that the more data we have, the better informed our decisions would be. Without effective ways of managing the data and using it to gather insights and hidden connections in our data sets, data piles up, clogs data servers, and is unusable.

The amount of collected data continues to grow exponentially. Some estimates are that 90% of all data ever collected has been generated in the past couple of years. Most of the data stored today are unstructured and include things such as text, blogs, clickstreams, tweets, and audio. This data is not organized in a way that allows for analysis.

Structured data is coded in a way that makes it easy to convert into a form usable for analysis. Examples of structured data include contact information such as first name, last name, email address, and phone number. In addition, quantitative fields like date of birth, date of transaction, and the amount received or amount due are forms of structured data.

Unstructured data refers to data that is more complex and possibly stored in a format that is not easily decoded. Unstructured data takes more time to parse through to retrieve the essential information. Examples of unstructured data include data stored in text or video format, comments on a web page, text messages, and videos of presentations or conferences.

Both structured and unstructured data are collected by most companies and are stored for potential use in record keeping and data analysis. Both types of data contain potentially useful information. The difference between structured and unstructured data lies in the form in which it is stored. While structured data is coded in an easily usable form, unstructured data requires a greater effort to extract.

One of the largest revolutions in today's business world has been the development of analytical tools to study unstructured data, which these days falls under the term big data. Big data is a large collection of data that is incapable of being processed by previous generations of analytical tools. Big data is rapidly changing the way businesses make decisions and understand customer behavior. Despite the evolution, integrating both structured and unstructured forms of data into a single database remains an important goal for businesses.

Big Data

Data amasses quickly. As businesses grow, the amount of data grows. In fact, the big data market is estimated to grow 45% annually for the foreseeable future. It is quite possible that this growth may even be underestimated. New and innovative ways of doing business are redefining how companies collect and use data. Big companies like Amazon and Netflix use data science to analyze customer experience, model customers, and align their product offerings to specific customer characteristics.

Information Systems

Information systems are collections of data and information used to support decision-making in organizations. While information systems do not have to rely on intricate technologies, technology is typically assumed to be one of the components. Some medical offices still use paper patient records and some libraries still use a catalog system on index cards. In this course and throughout your program, the term information systems will be used as a synonym for computer-based information systems.

Data Management

Data is a strategic resource for an organization, informing operations and providing insights. While some organizations use data effectively, most entities collect data and do so without properly securing it or effectively using it. A significant portion of the collected data may be sensitive and include personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers, names, and telephone numbers. When this data is not secure, instead of a strategic resource, data becomes a liability.

The infrastructure used to manage data in an organization is referred to as the data architecture. An organization must understand the data it collects and its IT processes. Business requirements can change often; flexible architectures support these changes and allow for both data collection and analysis.

Data resides either in-house or in the cloud. In other words, we could own the infrastructure that stores our data or share resources with other companies, typically provided by a third party. Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks. Cost is less of a factor due to the decreasing cost of data storage and infrastructure management.

There are three core variations of cloud-based systems:

infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
platform as a service (PaaS)
software as a service (SaaS)

The IaaS model provides access in a virtualized environment and the computing resources are composed of virtualized hardware. This includes things like network connections, virtual server space, and load balancers.

In the PaaS model, customers have access to a platform that supports the development and management of web applications. PaaS enables quicker development life cycles and reduced infrastructure requirements since the majority of processing happens in the cloud rather than on local storage and processor resources.

PaaS is commonly confused with IaaS. The difference lies in who manages the switching, routing, and operating systems. If the client is responsible for licensing the operating system and managing the back-end networking, it is considered IaaS. If the cloud service provider is responsible for licensing the operating systems and back-end storage and networking, it is considered PaaS.

With the SaaS model, the software is licensed to customers with subscriptions and central hosting. Some examples include Gmail, Google Docs, and Microsoft Office 365.

Explain the importance of ensuring that data and information systems support business goals and processes.
Data Sources

Extracting and building data about an organization requires tapping into a colossal system of information that exists within an organization and is tied together in many ways. To begin analyzing business processes, a business must first collect data from multiple platforms and portals. Data in businesses comes from various activities, including sales and marketing, finance, customer service, and relationship management.

Companies store data in multiple systems, including the customer relationship management (CRM) system and sales records, finance, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer applications. Each of these separate systems has a slice of data about the customer. When these data are integrated, the organization has a better view of the overall customer life cycle.

Data Quality

Data is valuable to organizations. Businesses that have used data to improve their marketing have realized the importance of data in increasing effectiveness and making better business decisions. However, not all data are equal, and not all data are clean; bad data costs companies money.

Good data enables businesses to do the following:

Analyze the current financial state of the organization in terms of net profits, revenues, cash flow, assets, and liabilities
Increase revenues through better targeting of products and increased customer satisfaction
Examine existing production processes to take corrective action, improve efficiency, and lower costs
Develop new, automated processes that integrate harmoniously into existing workflows and reduce demands on labor
Gather competitive information on product and pricing decisions to stay ahead of competitors
Make evidence-based decisions that utilize verifiable data to maximize profits and efficiency
Understand business value by exploiting rapid changes in information and generating insights from diverse data sources to widen the competitive differentiation gap

There are three general steps for transforming institutional knowledge into implementable data solutions: capturing, analyzing, and using.</div>

Describe characteristics of valuable data.
Differentiate between information and data.
Explain the importance of ensuring that data and information systems support business goals and processes.

The term data hygiene refers to the processes of ensuring the cleanliness of data (i.e., that the data is relatively error-free). Dirty data can be caused by things such as duplicate records, incomplete or outdated data, and mistakes introduced as data is entered, stored, and managed. Data quality is crucial to operational and transactional processes within an organization and to the reliability of analytical reporting.

Data scrubbing is the process of amending or removing data in a database that is incorrect, incomplete, improperly formatted, or duplicated. Typically, the process involves updating, standardizing, and de-duplicating records to create a single view of the data, even if it is stored in multiple systems.

Types of Bad Data	Description
Duplicate data	Two or more identical records
Conflicting data	The same records with differing attributes
Incomplete data	Missing attributes
Invalid data	Attributes not conforming to standardization
Unsynchronized data	Data not appropriately shared between two systems

Table. Types of Bad Data

Quality Data Attributes

Quality data is needed for effective decision-making. Quality data is typically defined as data that is precise, valid, reliable, timely, and complete. Different organizations will prioritize these attributes according to their needs. An organization might also include additional attributes.

Precision is an important attribute of data. Precision describes how precise the data is in the context of its intended use. Data collected in healthcare, for example, must be more precise than that of other industries.

Quality data is valid when it meets the requirements of the data collection process. If a data set that captures the age of patients contains values that are negative or greater than 120, using the invalid data might misinform the decision process.

Data should be reliable regardless of where it resides or how it was collected. Whether the patient’s age is in a paper folder in the medical office or in the electronic patient system, the values should be equal.

Data should be collected at the right time to be relevant to decision-making. When deciding how many boots could be sold in a city, data from purchases during fall and winter would be relevant to the decision. Because people do not usually buy boots in the summer, data on how many boots were sold during the summer is not relevant to the decision.

Quality data is complete and thorough, providing a full view of the relevant picture. Incomplete data can lead to serious situations. For example, if a medical office is trying to improve waiting time but leaves out data on various operational details, the results may skew understanding of the reasons for long waiting times, leading to decisions that do not address the real reasons.

Mei wakes up every morning to her alarm clock. She checks the weather forecast on her cell phone while selecting the settings on her coffee machine for her morning cup of coffee. She reads the news on her tablet and heads to work. Most of her work is done using her laptop, which is loaded with applications that help her manage the technology in the medical office where she works as a support specialist. Patients schedule their appointments using the office’s website, and Mei’s colleagues bill insurance agencies based on the medical services provided and recorded in the patient tracking system. Today, Mei is helping her colleagues narrate a PowerPoint presentation about improving patients’ waiting time and working with a vendor technician to ensure that the X-ray machine loads the imaging directly to a patient’s electronic health record. She intends to spend the evening playing virtual reality games using the gear she received as a birthday present.

A computer system, or a computer, is a system that consists of hardware and software components that work together to store, retrieve, and process data. We use computers to type documents, send emails, play games, browse the web, and create spreadsheets, presentations, and videos. Computer systems store data, direct the traffic on the internet, collect meteorological data, or perform analyses of survey results.

Computers were very easy to identify when they were the size of an entire room. Today computer systems are almost everywhere and embedded in many devices where one might not expect to find them. Special-purpose computers power digital cameras, run elevators, and control the temperature of your living area. Whether we recognize it or not, chances are that computers are in things we see everywhere we turn.

The Functions of a Computer System
Figure. A graphical presentation of the IPOS model. The arrows indicate the direction in which data and information flow
Diagram depicting the input-process-output-storage (IPOS) Model.

The input-process-output (IPO) and input-process-output-storage (IPOS) models are frequently used to explain the function of a system. They specify that input, processing, output, and storage are the four main functions of a computer system. The system divides the work into three categories: (1) a requirement from the environment or input, (2) a computation based on the requirement or process, and (3) a provision for the environment or output. In addition, it uses storage for the input and output elements, as well as for keeping the results of the calculations during the processing.

An information system takes in raw data entered by a user or acquired from a data source or sources (input), transforms the data in a purposeful fashion into information (process), and provides the results of the transformation to the user (output). Components of the information system keep the input data, information, and results from various phases of the transformation for the intermediate or permanent record (storage).

For example, the embedded computer in an alarm clock uses input, the waking time entered by pushing the various buttons. It monitors, throughout the night, how the waking time compares with the current time (process) and decides to sound the alarm (output) when the current time and waking time are equal. To enable the input, process, and output to function properly, the computer in the alarm clock stores the waking time and the current time in its memory to support the decisions of the processing unit.

People

The most important element of a computer system is its users, sometimes called liveware. Recall the roles of IT specialists. System analysts design the operating and processing of the system. System programmers write code to implement the working of the system. End users (users) operate the system for different purposes.</div>

Identify components of computer hardware.
The Components of a Computer System

A computer system is a collection of hardware, software, and middleware components (or a combination of these) that work together to transform data into information and meet a specific user’s need. The electronic and mechanical parts of a computer system are known as hardware, the data and the computer programs are referred to as software, and the components that share software and data between elements of a computer system (both hardware and software components) are known as middleware.

The components of a computer system that are tangible, such as monitors, tablets, keyboards, mouses, or smartphones, are examples of computer hardware. Computer hardware provides the physical elements that support each function of the IPO model. From the perspective of the IPO graphical model, hardware provides an environment in which each operation is performed, representing the boundaries of each box in the diagram. Specific hardware types support specific types of operations.

The components of a computer system that specify how data is transformed into information per the user specifications comprise computer software. Software is a collection of instructions that enable a user to interact with a computer to perform tasks. Internet browsers, text editing tools, and spreadsheets are examples of computer software. In the IPO model, software defines how each operation is performed. In other words, software outlines what is happening in each box of the IPO graphical model, particularly in the process box.

Middleware allows the hardware and software to communicate with each other, enabling data to move between computer system components. Middleware is represented by the arrows in the graphical IPO model.

Users are frequently emphasized as yet another component of the computer system.

Hardware

Hardware is the set of computer system components that one can touch. Those are the electronic and mechanical parts the system requires to operate. Motherboards, graphics cards, central processing units (CPUs), and power supply are some of the most prominent hardware components in a general-purpose computer system. This includes items such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. Though the form factor (size and shape) of the components can vary greatly, computer systems have these components in common.

The motherboard is at the center of what makes a computer work. It houses the CPU and serves as the brain of the system allocating resources, such as power, and communicating with all other components. The CPU processes the data from the programs your computer runs. Random-access memory (RAM) occupies the memory slots of the CPU and keeps that data immediately accessible. The hard drive is a storage device that permanently stores data, or temporarily stores data in a paging file system. This paging feature is a built-in mechanism available with most operating systems that permit data to be moved from RAM to the hard drive when the amount of memory in use exceeds the memory available on the computer system. A power supply unit supplies the system and allocates power among other components.

Software

Without hardware, there would be no way of running the essential software that makes computers run. Software programs run on your computer and provide instructions telling the computer what to do. The system software, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux, runs the computer by controlling its hardware components and peripherals. Application software are the programs that allow users to do specific tasks, such as edit text and images or send an email.

Word processing applications allow users to type letters, complete assignments, and produce any other written artifact. Spreadsheet applications help create charts and complete complex calculations. Email applications allow a user to receive and send email communications. Web browsers allow a user to access the content of web pages on various sites.</div>

Identify network types.
identify types of network hardware.
Describe the role of protocols in communication over networks.
Explain the role of the network as a framework for the business ecosystem.
Delineate the methods of process communication between client/server and the peer-to-peer model.

Networks are systems of hardware and software components that connect two or more devices for the purpose of sharing data and information.

There are two common types of networks: local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). LANs span a single home, school, or small office building and provide a connection for devices that are within the same network. WANs reach across cities, states, or even across the world. The internet is the world’s largest public wide area network.

Computer networks differ in design. The two types of network design include client-to-server and peer-to-peer. An example of a client-server implementation are servers on one side of the network running authentication to facilitate millions of users logging in and permitting access to specific resources based on parameters such as username, password, and system identifiers. In a peer-to-peer network, all devices tend to support the same functions. Access to resources is provided without the assistance of a server. BitTorrent is a protocol that enables peer-to-peer file sharing. Client-server networks are common across organizations and peer-to-peer networks are common in small offices and homes.

Physical Topology
Figure. Example of a physical topology.
Network devices are connected to a central hub.

Identifying how data flows is an important part of designing a network and is commonly drawn out using two different perspectives: logical and physical. This figure shows a physical topology, which is the actual layout of how systems are placed in the network.

Logical Topology

This figure is a logical topology. This form of a topology indicates how the data actually flow and is extremely important when considering things like load balancing normal traffic, network backups, and replication of data.

Figure. Example of a logical topology.
An example of how data could flow between the internet and computers on an organization's network.

Networks may implement various types of topologies. The most common network topology layouts are bus, star, ring, and mesh.

Languages supporting data exchange between computers are referred to as protocols. Different networks may support different protocols. The most popular protocol is TCP/IP and is commonly found on the internet and in home networks.

Special-purpose computer systems include network routers, access points, and switches. These devices, along with cable media such as fiber optic and Ethernet, make it possible for devices to communicate with each other. Network operating systems and other software applications generate network traffic and enable users to complete tasks.</div>

<div class="content">Section 3 Overview

The history of computers is generally divided into five periods or generations. Computer generations are defined by major technological developments that fundamentally changed the way computers operated. Most major developments have resulted in smaller, less expensive, more powerful, and more efficient computing systems.  

As a system of hardware, software, networking, and human components that function together, computers take input, process it, and provide an output while using storage to keep intermediate and final results of the transformation of data. The input-process-output-storage computing model focuses on the architecture of the four basic functions of the system and its components that support the manipulation and retention of the data.   

In this section you will review the main features of each generation of computers and explore the individual hardware components that support the function of computer systems.

Computer Hardware and History

When she was a little girl, Marie visited the bank where her mother worked. She remembers entering a huge, noisy, warm room full of hardware with punched cards and printouts lying around. The bank was proud to have the latest mainframe computer. Her mother would spend days organizing punched cards with instructions and data for tabulations of customers' accounts. Now, Marie uses multiple computers at work; she has a desktop on her work desk, a couple of laptops at home, and a smartphone she can use to complete tasks. She wonders how a room full of machinery transitioned to devices the size of a smartphone.

The Abacus
Figure. The abacus is a device that stores values represented by the position of the beads on the rods. The human operator carries out mathematical operations by moving the beads.

Today’s computer systems are the result of significant thought and technological developments spanning centuries. One of the earliest computing devices was the abacus, probably first used in China and then by the early Greek and Roman civilizations. The abacus consists of strings of beads strung on rods, which are mounted on a rectangular frame. As the beads are moved back and forth on the rod, their positions represent stored values. To carry out calculations, the abacus needs a human operator; otherwise, it is merely data storage. Thus, the abacus must be combined with a human to form a system whose purpose is carrying out additions.

The Leibniz Machine

More sophisticated computing machines emerged between the Middle Ages and the Modern Era when a few inventors began to experiment with the technology of gears. These machines represented data through gear positioning. The data was initially entered by mechanically positioning the gears in a specific gear position. The final gear position represents the output of the calculations. One such machine is the Leibniz machine in which the gears of the machine are initially mechanically set in a position that represents the input, and their final state represents the output of the calculations.

As the systems became more complex, they were able to perform more complex operations. The Leibniz machine was designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, and the algorithm for addition was embedded into the structure of the hardware itself. Babbage’s Analytical Engine (which was never constructed) was designed to read instructions in the form of holes on paper cards. In other words, Babbage’s Analytical Engine was programmable. Ada Lovelace, who published a paper demonstrating that the Analytical Engine is indeed programmable, is considered to be the world’s first programmer.

The ENIAC

The idea of communicating instructions with punched cards originated in 1801 in a system specifying the steps of the weaving process. Different patterns of holes resulted in different woven designs. Later, Herman Hollerith used punched cards to speed up the tabulation process in the 1890 U.S. census. Punched cards were heavily used for a variety of computing systems until the mid-1970s. Electronic advances at the beginning of the twentieth century enabled the production of complex hardware. Examples of this progress include the electromechanical machine of George Stibitz completed in 1940 at Bell Laboratories and Mark I completed in 1944 at Harvard University by Howard Aiken and a team of IBM engineers. These machines made heavy use of electronically controlled mechanical relays.

Paralleling these efforts, the use of vacuum tubes gave way to fully electronic computers, such as the Atanasoff-Berry machine constructed at Iowa State College between 1937 and 1941 and Colossus built in England to decode German messages during the latter part of World War II. Other more flexible machines, such as ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) developed at University of Pennsylvania, soon followed. From that point on, the development of computer systems largely depended on advancements in technology, such as the invention of the transistor. Later, the invention of complete circuits allowed for the integration of multiple circuits on one piece of semiconductor material, such as silicon. These integrated circuits reduced the size of the early computing systems of the 1940s from room-sized machines to machines the size of a single cabinet. Processing power began to double every two years. The mass production of integrated circuits made computers less expensive and thus more readily available in the market.

Desktop Computers

A major step in the popularization of computer systems was the development of desktop computers. Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak built the first viable home computer and established Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) in 1976 to mass-produce their garage-built home computer. Other companies, such as Commodore, offered similar solutions, but these smaller computers were not widely adopted by businesses, which continued to use the well-established mainframe computers. In 1981, IBM introduced its first desktop computer called the personal computer, or PC, whose underlying software was developed by a newly formed company known as Microsoft. The term PC is now widely used to refer to all machines that evolved from IBM’s personal computer product, including desktops and laptops.

Toward the end of the twentieth century, the ability to connect individual computers in a world-wide system called the internet was revolutionizing communication. The British scientist Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system by which documents stored on computers throughout the internet could be linked together producing a system of linked information called the World Wide Web. In order to make web pages more accessible to users, search engines (e.g., Bing and Google) and browsers (e.g., Edge and Chrome) were developed. Search engines use technologies to index and tag pages so users can quickly search for resources based on keywords.

The miniaturization of computing machines continued. Tiny computers are embedded today in a wide variety of electronic appliances and devices. Because hardware components are continuing to get smaller, the capabilities of smartphones continue to expand. These handheld computers are much more than mobile telephones. They are equipped with a wide variety of sensors, including cameras, microphones, compasses, and touch screens, as well as a number of wireless technologies used to communicate with other smartphones and computers.</div>

Identify features of computer hardware found within the four computer generations.
Vacuum Tubes (1946–1959)

ENIAC emerged in 1946 as a 30-ton machine with 18,000 vacuum tubes. When it was first being used, lights dimmed in sections of Philadelphia.

The first-generation computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and they were often enormous in size. They consumed a great deal of electricity and were expensive to operate. They often malfunctioned because of the excessive heat they generated.

This generation of computers relied on machine languages, the lowest-level programming languages understood by computers. They could run one program at a time and it took a long time, sometimes weeks, to set up a different program. Punched cards were used for input, and the computers printed out the outputs. EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer), UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer), IBM-701, and IBM-650 are other notable first-generation computers.

Vacuum tubes were the only electronic components available during the first generation of computers and could complete calculations within milliseconds. However, vacuum tubes were large, had limited storage capacity, were unreliable, and required a lot of maintenance.

Transistors (1959–1965)

Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the second generation of computers. Transistors were more reliable and economical. The smaller electronic components in the second generation could maintain two states, “Off” and “On,” represented by the binary digits 0 and 1, respectively. Although transistors were invented in 1947, it took almost a decade for them to find their place in computer hardware.

Second-generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output. Tapes and disks were used for storage purposes. The first computers of this generation were built for the atomic energy industry and included Honeywell 400, IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and UNIVAC 1108.

Over 100 computer programming languages were developed to work with second-generation computers. Machine languages representing instructions in binary (0s and 1s) were replaced by assembly languages that specified instructions using words. High-level programming languages were also developed, such as early versions of FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) and COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language).

While these computers were smaller in size, used less energy, and were easier to move, they were used for specific purposes and still required cooling systems and constant maintenance.</div>

Third Generation: Integrated Circuits (1965–1971)

The invention of integrated circuits enabled the development of computer systems that were cheaper, faster, smaller, and more reliable. Integrated circuits miniaturized transistors and placed them on silicon chips called semiconductors.

Users interacted with third-generation computers using keyboards and monitors that communicated with the other components of the hardware and operating systems. Operating systems made it possible for computers to run multiple applications at the same time and to share memory and other resources. The computational time was reduced from milliseconds to nanoseconds. While integrated circuits increased computing power, they were complicated to manufacture, difficult to maintain, and required air conditioning to keep the computers cool enough to run. Examples of third-generation computers include the PDP-8, PDP-11, ICL 2900, IBM 360, and IBM 370.

Fourth Generation: Microprocessors (1971–Present)

Microprocessors include thousands of integrated circuits on a single silicon chip. They created the fourth generation of computers. This generation of computers is characterized by a significant reduction in processor size and, at the same time, a significant increase in capabilities. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, included all the components of the computer on a single chip. It powered the Busicom calculator and paved the way for the personal computer. The first IBM computer for home use was available in 1981, followed by Apple’s Macintosh computer in 1984. Fourth-generation computers also saw the development of graphical user interfaces, the mouse, and handheld devices. Several operating systems, such as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, were developed during this time period.

Fourth-generation computers are more reliable than their predecessors, calculate in picoseconds (one trillionth of a second), use high-level languages, and are portable and economical.</div>

Identify current and emerging information technologies and their applications.
Artificial Intelligence

The fifth generation started in the early 1980s when microprocessor chips were able to accommodate tens of millions of electronic components using ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI). These computers are based on parallel processing (multiple programs running concurrently) and artificial intelligence (AI) software. They support the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing while using principles of robotics, neural networks, expert systems, and natural language understanding and generation.

Quantum computing, molecular technology, and nanotechnology are expected to significantly contribute to the abilities of fifth-generation computers. Fifth-generation computing devices will be able to respond to natural language input and are capable of learning. Emerging technologies may advance computers in unimaginable directions. Research efforts and experiments coupled with emerging technologies provide glimpses into the computers of the future.

Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is the study of a non-classical model of computation. It is said to be more efficient than modern computing through the use of quantum tunneling. Quantum computers are expected to reduce power consumption from 100 to 1,000 times and will allow computing to surpass any and all limits that traditional computing has set.

Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology and molecular manufacturing involves the use of nanoscale (extremely small) tools and nonbiological processes to build structures, devices, and systems at the molecular level. It is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of mechanosynthesis, or reaction outcomes determined by the use of mechanical constraints. Nanotechnology is a very diverse field, which is having a bigger and bigger impact on the world. It has applications in medicine, cars, spacecraft, food, electronics, and materials science just to name a few.</div>

Computer Hardware and History

Computer hardware includes the physical, tangible parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard, and so on, all of which are objects you can see and touch. In contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by the physical hardware. This section will help you understand the inner workings of your computer by introducing you to its basic components.

CPU
Figure. A CPU.

The CPU (central processing unit or processor) is responsible for processing all information from programs run by your computer. The speed at which the processor processes information is measured in gigahertz (GHz). This means that a processor advertising a high GHz rating will likely perform faster than a similarly specified processor of the same brand and age.

RAM
Figure. RAM.

Random-access memory, or RAM, is hardware found in the memory slots of the motherboard. The role of RAM is to temporarily store information created by programs and to do so in a way that makes this data immediately accessible. The tasks that require random memory could be rendering images for graphic design, editing video or photographs, or multitasking with multiple applications open.

Hard Drive
Figure. Hard drive.

The hard drive is a storage device responsible for storing permanent and temporary data. This data comes in many different forms but is essentially anything saved or installed to a computer; for example, computer programs, family photos, operating systems, word-processing documents, and so on. There are two different types of storage devices: the traditional hard disk drive (HDD) and the newer solid-state drives (SSD). Hard disk drives work by writing binary data onto spinning magnetic disks called platters that rotate at high speeds, while a solid-state drive stores data by using static flash memory chips.

Graphics Processor Unit
Figure. A graphics processor unit.

Especially important for 3D rendering, the graphics processing unit (GPU) does exactly what its name suggests and processes huge batches of graphic data. You will find that your computer’s graphics card has at least one GPU. As opposed to the basic on-board graphic capabilities that PC motherboards supply, dedicated graphics cards interface with the motherboard via an expansion slot to work almost exclusively on graphic rendering. This also means you can upgrade your graphics card if you want to get a bit more performance from your PC. Not only this, but modern GPUs fulfill a broad computational workload beyond just rendering, making them an extension to the central processing unit.

Expansion Card
Figure. An expansion card.

In computing, the expansion card, expansion board, adapter card, or accessory card is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane, or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.

An expansion bus is a computer bus that moves information between the internal hardware of a computer system (including the CPU and RAM) and peripheral devices. It is a collection of wires and protocols that allows for the expansion of a computer.</div>

You have already learned a bit about the basic components of a computer system, a system of hardware, software, networking, and human components that function together. Now take another look at the diagram introduced earlier in this section.

The IPOS (input-process-output-storage) model explains what computer systems are used for. They take input, process it, and provide an output while using storage to keep intermediate and final results of the transformation of data. Individual hardware components support the function of computer systems. Generally, computer hardware contains three major components: the central processing unit, storage, and peripheral devices.

The central processing unit supports data processing. Computer memory stores ephemeral programs and data in use temporarily for quick access and primarily stores it in RAM.

Describe the role of a central processing unit (CPU) in a computing environment.
Identify components of computer hardware.

The central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuit responsible for executing computer program instructions. The CPU consists of three parts: 

the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which contains circuitry that performs operations on data (such as addition and subtraction); 
the control unit, which contains the circuitry coordinating the machine’s activities; and 
the processor register, which contains data storage cells called registers.

Registers are high-speed storage areas in the CPU. All data must be stored in a register before it can be processed. They serve as temporary holding places for data being manipulated by the CPU. Registers hold the inputs to the ALU and store the results. To perform an operation on data stored in the main memory, the control unit

transfers the data from the main memory into the registers,
informs the ALU which registers hold the data,
activates the ALU, and
tells the ALU which register should receive the result.

Memory/Mass Storage

The memory unit consists of random-access memory (RAM), sometimes referred to as primary or main memory. Unlike a hard drive (permanent memory, secondary memory), this memory is fast and directly accessible by the CPU. Loading data from secondary to primary memory allows the CPU to operate faster. However, RAM is ephemeral, meaning data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off.

RAM is split into partitions. Each partition consists of an address and its contents, all in binary form. The address uniquely identifies every location in the memory.

In addition to RAM, read-only memory (ROM) is another component that stores instructions for crucial system activities, including booting up the system and initializing different computer components.

Peripheral Devices

Various units that support the input and output functions are collectively called peripheral devices and comprise the I/O unit. Input devices, such as keyboards, mouses, and sensors, are used to move data into computers. Output devices, such as printers and monitors, are used to move information out of computers.</div>

Buses or bus lines are the wires that serve as electrical roadways, transmitting information between the CPU and other components. The size of the bus is related to the amount of data that can be transmitted at once. Instructions are sent through the bus lines to the CPU and include how to process the data and which component to use. These instructions are split and sent through three different types of buses: address buses, data buses, and control buses.

Buses Diagram

Differentiate between motherboard components, their purposes, and properties.

The system unit, also known as a tower or chassis, encases various components already mentioned: the motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, and any other internally installed components. The term system unit is often used to differentiate between the computer and its peripheral devices.

Components of the System Unit

The Motherboard

Again, the motherboard is the main circuit board for the computer containing both soldered components that cannot be removed and sockets or slots for components that can be removed. The motherboard holds the CPU, RAM, and ROM chips, as well as other hardware components. RAM stores instructions and data while they are being used. This storage is volatile, which means when the system is turned off, the contents in RAM are lost. Unlike RAM, ROM chips are nonvolatile memory, keeping their content whether the system is on or off, and generally contain instructions for starting up the computer.

Computer Processing Unit (CPU)

You have already learned that the CPU is the brain of the computer. It executes instructions and tells other components what to do.

The System Clock

The system clock sends out a pulse of electricity at regular intervals. The electronic components of the computer need these electric pulses in order to operate. The more pulses sent out by the system clock, the faster the computer. One instruction gets processed per pulse. Multiple processing units and a higher clock speed increase the processing speed of the computer system. The system speed commonly is measured in two primary measurements:

megahertz (MHz), which converts to millions of pulses per second
gigahertz (GHz), which converts to billions of pulses per second
Expansion Slots

Expansion slots are sockets on the motherboard where expansion cards can be installed. Common types of expansion cards include graphics, sound, and network cards.

Ports

Ports are sockets that allow cables to be plugged in without opening the system unit. Some examples are serial, parallel, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, which are recognizable by their distinct shapes.</div>

Identify components of computer hardware.
Identify storage and input/output (I/O) systems including different media and file systems.
Identify the categories of computers according to their components and capabilities.
Classify peripherals by their role (input, output, temporary memory, storage).
Differentiate between input, output, and storage.

Secondary storage devices hold data and information permanently. Secondary storage devices store data and instructions while they are not being used; the saved content remains on the secondary storage unit even when the computer is powered down. There is a variety of secondary storage types, including floppy and hard drives, flash drives, magnetic tape, and optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs.

A bit is the smallest unit of storage that is set to 0 or to 1. Bits need to be combined to create a useful representation of data or information; a group of eight bits forms a byte. A byte contains enough information to store a single character, such as the letter “M.”

Computer Storage and Memory

Computer storage and memory are often measured in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB). A medium-sized novel contains about 1 MB of information. 1 MB is 1,024 kilobytes, or 1,048,576 (1024x1024) bytes, not one million bytes. However, you may find documents that estimate each MB to 1,000 KB. When planning storage requirements, be sure to verify the accuracy of the documented storage capacity. Similarly, 1 gigabyte (GB) is 1,024 MB, 1 terabyte (TB) is 1,024 GB, and 1 petabyte (PB) is 1,024 TB. For another point of reference, 1 TB is roughly equivalent to 1,500 CDs worth of data, and 1 PB of data would create over 1.5 million CDs, a stack a mile high.


Unit	Equivalent in Bytes
1 kilobyte (KB)	2^10 or 1,024 bytes
1 megabyte (MB)	2^20 or 1,048,576 bytes
1 gigabyte (GB)	2^30 or 1,073,741,824 bytes
1 terabyte (TB)	2^40 or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes
1 petabyte (PB)	2^50 or 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes

Figure. Computer System with input and output devices.

Input devices translate data into a form that the computer can understand, and output devices translate information into a form that humans can understand.

The keyboard is the most common input device. Direct input devices such as pointing devices (mouse and trackball) and scanning devices (bar code readers) are much faster and have less room for error compared to the keyboard. Styluses, cameras, and microphones are input devices more commonly used in smartphones.

Monitors and printers are the most common output devices. Monitors present the output on a screen, and printers produce hard copies on paper. Other examples of output devices include speakers, 3D printers, and projectors.

Identify the I/O devices attached to the system unit of the machine you are using. Consider how each device supports your communication with the computer system.

Communication Devices

Communication devices allow a computer to send and receive data to and from other computers. Modems send information over a phone line or coaxial cable, whereas a network card sends information over dedicated network cables. Satellite, wireless, and Bluetooth technologies enable data to be transmitted without the need for physical wires. Satellite communication uses radio signals and orbiting satellites to receive and send data from one system to another. Bluetooth adapters facilitate wireless communication between electronic devices. Common devices that use Bluetooth include hands-free earpieces, wireless keyboards, mouses, and microphones.</div>

Computers are categorized based on their size and processing speed.

Supercomputers are the biggest and fastest computers, designed to process huge amounts of data. They are built as a system of thousands of interconnected processors. Supercomputers are particularly useful in scientific and engineering applications such as weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and nuclear energy research.

Mainframe computers are designed to support hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously. They also support multiple programs at the same time, making them useful to big organizations that manage and process high volumes of data.

A workstation is a single-user computer designed for technical or scientific applications. It has a faster microprocessor, a large amount of RAM, and high-speed graphics cards. It generally performs a specific job with great expertise. Graphics, music, and engineering design departments often use this type of system.

A microcomputer is more commonly known as a personal computer. It is a general-purpose computer for individual use. It has a memory, storage, input and output units, and a microprocessor as a central processing unit. Desktops, laptops, and handheld or mobile devices are all microcomputers.

ASPECT	Laptop	Desktop	Handheld / Mobile
Performance	Laptops perform far better than handhelds, but rarely as well as equivalently priced desktops.	Memory expandability and faster processors allow for best performance among microcomputers.	Multimedia and graphics are extremely limited compared to laptops and desktops, as handheld devices are primarily intended for information storage and management. They can have many specialized applications and often come integrated into cell phones.
Size / Portability	Laptops fit in a bag or a carrying case. The system unit includes all hardware components. Wireless  technologies support connecting to other systems and peripheral devices.	Desktops are difficult to transport as the system has many physical units, including the system unit, monitors, and keyboards.	Handhelds are usually pocket-sized and easy to carry. All components of the system are encased in the system unit. Bluetooth, Near-Field Communications (NFC), and other technologies allow connection to other I/O devices.
Weight	Laptops are generally light and easy to carry around. It is unusual for a laptop to weigh more than seven pounds.	Desktops and their associated equipment are heavy and difficult to move.	Handhelds are extremely light, often less than one pound.</div>

Introduction to Computer Networks

While working, Mei listens to music from her smartphone via wireless speakers. When she needs to print a document, she uses one of the two printers the employees of the medical office share. Patient records reside in the cloud and are managed by authorized users. The X-ray machine automatically uploads the patients' images in their records for viewing by a physician or radiologist. The office uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology for its telephony. The receptionist uses scheduling software. Another software system manages the status of each patient checked in, along with the procedure being performed. Management can easily see how full the waiting room is by using the network of cameras they installed several years ago. Mei’s computers are connected to different networks and help her access the data and resources she needs to be successful in her role. Mei dreads when the network in the office is unavailable throughout the day, so Mei checks the networks to see if she could proactively mitigate connectivity and resource-sharing issues before they start affecting the work in the medical office.

Sharing information and resources through linked computer systems is called networking. This enables users to exchange messages and share resources, such as printers, software packages, and data storage devices. Network software and its configurations manage the operations of the network interfaces. We will investigate how to effectively design, manage, and secure networks.

Network Types

Networks are commonly classified based on the physical distance between components (geographic scope). According to this classification, there are three major categories of networks: personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), and wide area network (WAN).

Figure. Example of a PAN.
Description of PAN diagram
PAN

A PAN is normally used for short-range communications, within a few feet, such as wireless headphones to a smartphone or a wireless mouse to a PC.

Figure. Example of a LAN.
Description of LAN diagram
LAN

LANs consist of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex. For example, the computers in a manufacturing building may be connected via a LAN.

WAN

WANs link systems over a greater distance, including machines on the opposite sides of the world.</div>

Other classifications of networks consider whether the network’s internal workings are based on designs that are in the public domain (open network) or on designs owned or controlled by third parties (closed or proprietary networks). Open network designs are freely circulated and are often more popular than proprietary designs that are restricted by license fees and contracts. The internet is an example of an open network. Communication over the internet is governed by an open collection of standards known as the TCP/IP protocol. Anyone is free to use these protocols without paying fees or signing license agreements. In contrast, an IT company might develop proprietary systems for which it chooses to maintain ownership rights, allowing the company to draw income from selling or leasing its system.

Figure. Example of a bus network.
Description of bus diagram
Bus

Yet another classification of networks considers the topology of the network or the pattern in which the machines are connected. Four common topologies are bus, star, ring, and mesh. Bus and star network topologies are the most common. In a bus network, the machines are connected to a common communication line called a bus.

Figure. Example of a star network.
Description of star network diagram
Star

Star networks have a single machine serving as a central point to which all others are connected.

Figure. Example of a ring network.
Description of ring network diagram
Ring

Ring topologies connect directly to each other as a peer.

Figure. Example of a mesh network.
Description of mesh network diagram
The mesh network diagram looks much like the ring network diagram in that the computers appear to be arranged in a circle and connected to one another. However, their connections are drawn as straight lines rather than curved ones. In addition, their connections to non-adjacent computers in the network are drawn straight across, so that the connections inside the ring form a five pointed star.
Mesh

Mesh connects every device in a network to every other device; mesh networks enable redundancy while also introducing significantly more network traffic.

Alternatively, a network could use a hybrid of these topologies.

The bus topology became popular in the 1990s when it was implemented under a set of standards/protocols known as the Ethernet. The star topology has roots as far back as the 1970s when it evolved from the idea of a large central computer system servicing many users at once. The star topology is used today in wireless networks where communication is carried out via radio broadcast to a central machine called the access point (AP).</div>

Discuss the features of cluster, grid, and cloud computing.

Networks rely on protocols to govern communication. Without protocols, the computers in a network might try to transmit messages at the same time or fail to provide needed assistance to other machines. Using protocols, vendors are able to build products for network applications that are compatible with products from other vendors.

Methods of Process Communication

Interprocess communication allows the activities or processes on different computers within a network to coordinate actions and complete tasks.

Client/Server Model
Figure. Example of communication in client/server networking model.
Description of Client-Server network diagram
Client-Server Network diagram with computers connected together through a switch. In the diagram, the switch appears in the middle. Above the switch, from left to right, are a desktop computer labeled computer A, a server labeled directory server, a server labeled file server, and a computer labeled computer b. Below the switch, there are two additional computers (Computer C and Computer D, respectively) and two laptops (laptop A and laptop B, respectively). Blue curvy lines represent the cables connecting each of the devices to the switch.

The client/server model is a popular convention used for interprocess communication. The basic roles played by the processes are categorized as either a client making requests or a server satisfying client requests. An early application of the client/server model appeared in networks connecting clusters of offices with a single printer available to all computers. The printer (also known as the print server) is the server, and the machines are clients requesting printed documents. Early networking systems also used file servers that accepted requests for company data that were centrally stored.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
Figure. Example of communication in peer-to-peer networking model.
Description of peer-to-peer network diagram

Peer-to-peer (P2P) is another model for interprocess communication. In this model, processers both request and provide service to each other. Instant messaging and interactive games played by users on multiple machines are both examples of the P2P model.

A new generation of P2P services arose to fill the void, expanding the range of sharable file types and further decentralizing networks. The Gnutella protocol operates without any centralized server and allows for numerous software clients to be used for access, which makes it nearly impossible to shut down. BitTorrent, used commonly for distributing large video files, employs a “swarm” model, whereby files are downloaded in simultaneous pieces from multiple host computers. Newer services have established degrees of encryption and anonymity to protect users from legal action by copyright holders.

Distributed Systems

Interactions between computers via networks have become commonplace and multifaceted. Many modern systems, such as global information retrieval systems or computer games, are designed as distributed systems. Distributed systems execute software as processes on more than one computer.

There are several types of distributed systems. 

Cluster computing uses many independent computers to provide computation or services comparable to those of a larger machine. The cost of several individual machines can be less than a higher-priced supercomputer, with comparable performance. Cluster computing provides high availability as it is likely that at least one computer in the cluster will be able to answer a request even when others in the cluster are unavailable or broken down. In addition, clusters can balance loads by automatically shifting requests among the cluster members.
Grid computing is a type of distributed system that is more loosely coupled than clusters but still works together as a system to complete large tasks. Grid computing typically includes specialized software to make it easier to distribute the workload and data among the machines in the grid.
Cloud computing provides large pools of shared computers that can be allocated to clients as needed. Services such as Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud allow clients to rent virtual computers by the hour no matter where the associated computer hardware is located. Services such as Google Cloud and Google Apps allow users to collaborate or build web services without needing to know how many computers are working on the problem or where the relevant data is stored. Cloud computing provides reasonable guarantees for reliability and scalability while raising concerns about security and privacy.</div>

Identify types of network hardware.

A network is a collection of two or more connected devices that can communicate with one another. Before we talk about the hardware that processes messages on a network, let’s start with the lowest level of components in a network: the transmission media. A transmission medium (the singular form of the word “media”) is simply a component that carries data from one network device to another. There are two types of transmission media: wired and wireless. 

Transmission Media
Figure. Twisted pair cable.

Data travels through a network using communication channels that connect the network components. Both wired and wireless networks require network media to transfer data. Twisted pair cables, coaxial cable, and optical fiber cables are common network media used in wired networks, while wireless networks use radio waves, microwaves, and infrared waves.

Twisted pair cables are the most widely used type of transmission media. Two common types of twisted pair cables are unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). STP cables consist of two separately insulated copper wires wound around each other, making them more expensive than UTP cables. The insulating sheath on STP cables protects the wires from things like neighboring unshielded cables and electromagnetic interference from fluorescent lights. Twisted pair cables come in various bandwidth capacities with a maximum segment length of 100 meters (328 feet).

Network Bandwidth

Network bandwidth is typically measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and gigabits (Gbps) per second. (Note the distinction between Mbps and MB. One megabit is equivalent to 1,000 kilobits, whereas one megabyte is equivalent to 1,024 kilobytes.)


Category	Maximum Bandwidth
CAT1	1 Mbps
CAT2	4 Mbps
CAT3	10 Mbps
CAT4	16 Mbps
CAT5	100 Mbps
CAT5e	1 Gbps
CAT6	10 Gbps
CAT7	10 Gbps
Table. Cable category and bandwidth.

Coaxial Cables
Figure. Coaxial cable.

Coaxial cables (often referred to as "coax") have an outer plastic that is used in computer networks and to deliver cable TV services. First used commercially in the 1940s, it is used for both baseband and broadband data communication services. The bandwidth of coaxial cables is about 80 times the bandwidth of twisted wires. Cable modems and televisions typically use coaxial cables.

Baseband is a signal at a very narrow frequency range on which data or information is superimposed and then transmitted. Examples include Ethernet LANs and serial cables.

Broadband is considered high-capacity transmission technologies that are used to transmit data, voice, and video across long distances and at high speeds. Examples include coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, and radio waves.

Fiber-Optic Cable
Figure. Fiber-Optic Cable.

Fiber-optic cable uses the concept of reflection of light through a core made up of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding. Fiber-optic cable are able to transmit large volumes of data. Their bandwidth can provide up to 26,000 times the bandwidth of the twisted pair wires, at the time of this writing.

Wireless Transmission

The use of wireless transmission media is sometimes more convenient and practical than installing cables. Electromagnetic waves of different frequencies, such as infrared or radio waves, can be used to transmit data within a network with the use of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or even near field communication. These radio waves are what is used to carry radio signals far distances to other networked devices.

Many believe Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity. However, it is just a play on words according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and it was created by a marketing team. Wi-Fi adapters are commonly installed on mobile computer devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Wi-Fi adapters enable devices to connect to each other or to the internet. Each of these wireless transmission methods has its own protocols to identify how to connect and transmit or receive data. Each uses different frequencies, which makes it possible for data to travel over small and large distances. These wireless technologies are examples of wireless media that can exchange data, such as sending audio to a Bluetooth speaker, sending files from one PC to another, or making a payment with your smartphone at the grocery store through near field communication (NFC). Bluetooth supports distances shorter than 30 feet, while Wi-Fi devices can be accessed up to 300 feet away.</div>

Describe the purpose and function of fundamental communication system hardware.
Describe the role of protocols in communication over networks.

Local Area Networks (LAN) can be connected to create a larger network and sometimes become Wide Area Networks (WAN). These connected networks can expand and increase communication and effectiveness of the organization. The following devices can be used to connect networks:

Repeaters extend the range of cabling types so connections can be made by increasing the strength of the network signal. For example, if two twisted pair cabling networks are 500 feet apart, a repeater can be used to extend the 300 feet range of twisted pair cabling to 500 feet. Repeaters can be used on fiber and coaxial also.
Bridges are used to connect to different types of network and provide management of the message. For example, a bridge can connect a twisted pair and coaxial network. The bridge analyzes the network message and will only bridge the network if a message is addressed to a device on the other side.
Switches are used on LANs to reduce network traffic by management of network messages. Older devices would broadcast all messages to all devices on the LAN. For example, on a 100-device network, a switch would only send one message to the destination device. This management example would create 99% less traffic.
Routers are the device that makes the internet possible. A router connected to your LAN acts as gateway to the internet. (This device on your LAN can be also be called a Gateway.) Routers manage network traffic by having a routing table of known devices. If a destination address is unknown to the Router, it will forward the message to another router. This analyze and forward process continues until the message reaches the correct address.</div>

DARPA hoped to develop a method for linking multiple computer networks, allowing them to function as a single system unaffected by disasters degrading the performance of local components.

Figure. The three tiers of ISPs.
Description of ISP diagram
The Three Tiers of ISPs

The individual networks comprising the internet are constructed and maintained by internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs are classified in tiers depending on the role they play in the overall internet structure.

Tier 1, at the top of the ISP hierarchy, is the least common type of ISP and serves as the backbone of the internet. Tier 1 ISPs consist of high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs that are typically operated by large communication companies.

Tier 2 ISPs are more common and regional in scope. Tier 1 and Tier 2 ISPs are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the internet’s communication infrastructure.

Tier 3 ISPs (access ISPs) are typically independent internets, sometimes called intranets, operated by a single organization that supplies internet access to homes and businesses. The devices used to connect to the access ISP are called end systems or hosts. These include common internet devices such as PCs, laptops, and smartphones, but also devices such as cameras, automobiles, and home appliances. A variety of technologies are used to connect end systems to larger networks. Common connecting technologies are telephone lines, cables, and satellites.</div>

Explain how communication takes place through the Internet.
Explain the role of a domain name system (DNS).

Internet networking systems use addressing systems to assign a unique identifier to each computer in the network. The internet uses IP (internet protocol) addresses as unique identifiers. The internet used a 32-bit address pattern (IP version 4 or IPv4) to uniquely identify all of the internet components until we ran out of unique identifiers. Today we use 128-bit addresses (IP version 6 or IPv6) in addition to legacy IPv4 addresses.

The ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), a nonprofit organization that coordinates the internet’s operations, awards blocks of consecutively numbered IP addresses to ISPs. ISPs then assign a unique IP address to each machine within their region of authority.

IPv4 addresses are traditionally written in dotted decimal notation, with the bytes of the address separated by periods. An IPv4 address might look something like this: 192.207.177.103. IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal; an IPv6 address could look like this:  2001:DB8:12:34::1111.

While the dotted decimal notation works well for computers, people needed a different method of identification. An alternative system accesses machines using mnemonic names. This system is based on domains—a section of the internet operated by a single authority, such as a university or a business. The domain name of Western Governors University is "wgu.edu." The suffix "edu" is a top-level domain (TLD) denoting an educational institution. Other top-level domains include "com" for commercial institutions, "gov" for government agencies, "org" for nonprofit organizations, "tv" for television stations, and so on. TLDs include two-letter country codes, such as "au" for Australia and "kr" for Korea.

DNS (domain name system): DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized system that translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP (internet protocol) addresses—which computers use to identify one another on a network.

Domain names: These are the familiar, easy-to-read names that are used to navigate the internet, such as "www.google.com." These names are easier for humans to remember than IP addresses.

Hierarchy: The DNS system is organized hierarchically. At the top of the hierarchy are the root DNS servers, which direct requests to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers. TLDs include extensions like ".com," ".org," ".net," and country-code TLDs, such as ".uk" and ".de."

DNS resolution: This is the process of translating a domain name into an IP address.

Just as the ICANN assigns batches of IP addresses to ISPs, every domain must be registered with the ICANN.

Internet Applications

In the earlier days of the internet, most applications were simple programs that followed a network protocol. Network protocols are rules, procedures, and formats that govern the communication of multiple devices over a network. This ensures timely, secure, and managed network communication. As web servers and browsers became more sophisticated, traditional networks became handled by web pages using the powerful hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).

Multiple applications are used for exchanging messages between end users over a network, including instant messaging (IM), browser-based online chatting, tweets on Twitter, Facebook walls, and email (electronic mail system).

While most users rely on sophisticated applications to send and receive an email, the actual email transmission is supported by basic network protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP uses Domain Name System (DNS) lookups to identify the recipient of the email and send the message over the internet to a mail server where it can be retrieved using protocols such as POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is used for voice communication over the Internet. VoIP operates by establishing a connection between two devices and then performing real-time, two-way transmission of audio data. Softphones allow two or more computers to share a call without any additional hardware. Analog telephone adapters allow users to connect their physical phones to a port that digitizes and then transmits real-time audio data.

Transporting audio and video data across the Internet in near real-time is referred to as streaming. Most applications in this category are now on-demand streaming in which the end user expects to view or listen to media at an arbitrary time of their choosing, unlike broadcasting where a server transmits content to several users simultaneously like traditional radio and TV stations. Large-scale streaming services use content delivery networks (CDNs), which are groups of servers distributed strategically over the internet that stream copies of content to nearby end users. A networking technology called anycast enables an end user to connect to the closest server automatically.

Explore: Determine Your IP Address

Using the site "What is my IP?" (opens new tab) (or another tool), determine the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the computer you are using. Knowing your IP address is crucial for online gaming, tech support, using remote desktop connections, connecting to a security camera DVR, retaining anonymity, or even running an email server. Always keep your IP address secret. Do not share it with anyone.</div>

Identify the parts of a uniform resource locator (URL).

In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee realized the potential of combining internet technology with hypertext (linked documents), leading to the World Wide Web, which quickly became the dominant application of the internet. The World Wide Web (WWW) is composed of a hypertext document format for embedding hyperlinks to other documents, a protocol for transferring hypertext over the network, and a server process that supplies hypertext pages upon request. Today, the WWW also supports images, audio, and video.

Software packages that allow users to access hypertext are either browsers or web servers. A browser resides on the user’s machine to obtain the requested materials and present them to the end user in an organized way. The web server resides on the computer containing the hypertext documents. HTTP protocol or similar protocols are used to transfer data between web servers and browsers.

Each hypertext document available through the World Wide Web is given a unique address called a uniform resource locator (URL). The URL includes the protocol, domain, and all subdomains, as well as the resource path ID and name of the document. This information collectively indicates the location of the document on the server. The following is a commonly structured model of a URL: http://subdomain.domain.top-level-domain/directory-path/document_name.html

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a way of encoding a document. Special symbols called tags describe how the document should appear on a display screen, what multimedia resources (audio, video, images) should accompany the document, and which elements within the document are linked to other documents. A generalized language, the extensible markup language (XML), provides a standardized style for designing notational systems for representing data as text files. XML emphasizes semantics, while HTML focuses on appearance.</div>

A computer connected to a network is at risk for unauthorized access and vandalism. There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections. Many of those incorporate the use of malicious software or malware. Malware might be transferred to and executed on the computer itself or might attack the computer from a distance.

Malware

Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network (by contrast, software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency is typically described as a software bug). A wide variety of types of malware exist, including computer viruses, worms, spyware, and phishing to name a few.

A virus is a software program that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine. When the "host" program is executed, the virus is also executed, possibly performing degradations of portions of the operating system, erasing large amounts of data, or corrupting data and other programs.

A worm is an autonomous program that forwards copies of itself to other machines in a network and could result in detriment of individual machines or the operations of the network.

Spyware is another form of malicious software. Spyware resides on a computer, collecting information about the computer’s activities and reporting back to the spyware’s instigator. Passwords or credit card numbers can be exposed via spyware.

Phishing is another technique used to obtain private information by simply asking for it. The perpetrator sends emails posing as a legitimate business asking for information.

Other Attacks

In contrast to internal infections that affect a computer system from the inside, a computer system can be attacked from other computers in a network. An example is the denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages and results in suffocating the network resources. Packet sniffing is another form of attack, also referred to as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker intercepts the data as it is traveling to or from the victim’s device, including authentication credentials. MITM is just one way an attacker can get unauthorized access to resources and systems. Another method could be through a brute force attack. This is where the attacker uses all possible combinations of characters to learn a user’s password. There are multiple variations of the brute force attack, such as rainbow table attack and dictionary attack.

Dictionary attacks are performed by the attacker by using an application and a large dictionary text file with just words. When the attacker runs the application, it tries identifying the password by trying hundreds or thousands of words per minute from that dictionary file.

In most applications, passwords are not stored in plain text like “PassW0rd” and are often stored as scrambled text, or hash values, similar to “298cde70c32a57b84d0a546fedbb2596.” Rainbow tables try to identify the hash value of the password, then convert it back to plain text.</div>

List common security best practices.

The saying "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" certainly holds for keeping network connections secure. One primary prevention technique is to filter the traffic passing through a point in the network using a program called a firewall. Firewalls block outgoing messages with certain destination addresses or block incoming messages from untrustworthy sources.

Another preventative tool is the proxy server, a software that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server to shield the client from adverse actions of the server.

Network auditing software monitors network behaviors such as the origin and volume of traffic, looking for anomalies to proactively or reactively mitigate unwanted occurrences.

Antivirus software detects and removes known viruses from the network.

In some cases, the purpose of network vandalism is to disrupt the system. In other cases, the goal is to gain information. Traditional means of protecting information is to control access through the use of passwords. However, passwords can be compromised and are of little value when data is transferred over a network. Encryption encodes information to keep it confidential even if the data is stolen.</div>

Data breaches occur frequently. Malicious actors try various techniques to gain unauthorized access to data. Mei tries to keep current of these trends since the network and data in her office are not immune to such attacks. She is constantly tasked with applying security patches, scanning through suspicious email, and taking other precautions to prevent such attacks, and she must have a plan for mitigating the impact of potential attacks should they affect her medical office.

Data can be compromised at any time, and companies must be diligent about protecting secure data. It is not uncommon for time to pass before a data breach is even discovered and actions are taken. In addition, companies do not like to publicize malicious data attacks and data breach events that could negatively impact their reputation and revenue, so it is often difficult to obtain much information about such occurrences. However, there have been many widely known attacks that have come to light simply as a result of the size of their impact (sometimes affecting millions of unsuspecting individuals), such as the attack on Equifax in 2017, the attack on Marriott International in 2014, and the attack on the game developer Zynga in 2019.

In May 2017, personally identified data from millions of consumers were stolen from Equifax when the company’s web portal was hacked. The hackers exploited the credit bureau’s unpatched system, gaining access to username and password combinations. In September of the same year, the company finally announced the discovery of the data breach and estimated a direct impact of 147 million people. 

Now, hackers are able to successfully gain access to systems and data through more complex and sophisticated social engineering attacks. In 2018, a U.S. school district in the process of having a new school built was contacted via email requesting that they update their banking information, including completing a new electronic funds transfer (EFT) form. The school district confirmed the request was legitimate and provided the updated information before making a $2.5 million payment to the contractor. As you might have guessed, the contractor never received this payment. Instead, the school district had become the victim of a type of social engineering scam called a business email compromise (BEC). A small portion of the $2.5 million payment was recovered, but the perpetrators of the BEC have never been caught.

In July 2019, Zynga experienced a breach that affected 200 million players of its popular games Draw Something and Words with Friends. Hackers gained access to email addresses, usernames, passwords, and more.

In 2014, hackers accessed Marriott International’s reservation system and exposed the private details of up to 500 million customers, including names, addresses, credit card numbers, phone numbers, passport numbers, travel locations, and arrival and departure dates.

<div class="content">Section 5 Overview

Typical computer systems house a variety of software developed for different needs. The most common software classification includes system and application software. The operating systems, as prominent examples of system software, serve as an interface between the computer hardware and application software, while the programming languages and the software allow their compilation or interpretation. This allows the user to use high-level language to develop applications for a specific purpose. Some software products are available as free products, and others require licensing to be purchased for a fee.

In this section, you will explore the different categories of software and dig deeper into operating systems and the principles of programming languages. Finally, you will learn about the various distribution and pricing options associated with software products.

Mei wakes up every morning to the sound of the alarm on her Android smartphone. While getting ready for work, she streams the news on her smart TV. She uses the GPS system in her car to drive the quickest route to work. Today she is installing a new security camera, so she needs to identify and install the correct driver for it based on the operating system they use in the office. After work, she does homework for completing her data analytics program: she is writing a Python code to explain how weather patterns in Atlanta, Georgia, have changed over the past century.

Typical computer systems house a variety of software developed for different needs. Software is classified in multiple schemes according to different attributes. The existence of multiple taxonomies for software classification can be confusing. For example, users of Microsoft’s Windows operating system will find a group of programs in "Accessories" and "Administrative Tools" that include collections of applications that we will refer to as utility software. Mac operating systems organize similar software in "System Preferences" and Android in "Settings." A common taxonomy simply does not exist.

Application and System Software

Software can be divided into application and system software. System software is general-purpose software that is used to operate computer hardware. It provides a platform to run application software. Application software is specific-purpose software used to perform a specific task.

Application Software

Application software consists of the programs that perform tasks specific to the machine’s general purpose. A computer used to maintain a store’s inventory needs different software than a machine used by a mechanical engineer. Spreadsheet, database, desktop publishing, accounting, and program development software are all examples of application software. Those who are not in the IT field might refer to application software as productivity or collaboration software or tools.

System Software

System software performs tasks that are common to computer systems in general. The system software provides the infrastructure needed to run application software, allowing it to interface with the hardware of the computer system. System software can be divided into utility software and operating systems. Operating systems contain the user interface and the kernel of the operating system.

Explain how operating systems relate to application software.
List common operating systems.

An Operating System (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

Types of operating systems

Operating systems typically come in four categories: network operating systems, server operating systems, mobile operating systems, or personal computer operating systems. Many types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features.

Operating Systems

Operating systems typically fall into one of four categories. Many types of operating systems are available, each with different file structures and features. Three of the most common operating systems are Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Windows. Windows is developed by Microsoft, Inc. (Microsoft). Windows is a closed-source operating system, also known as proprietary software, because only the company that owns the software can modify the code. Windows OS maintains the largest market share for server and personal computer operating systems. Typically, Microsoft products are known for their easy-to-use design with a clearly displayed screen using graphics and text.
MacOs. macOS is developed by Apple, Inc. (Apple). Like Microsoft, Apple’s operating systems are closed-source and designed to only run on Apple hardware. macOS is known for its media editing and graphic rendering capabilities and it’s ability to integrate with other Apple products.
Linux. Linux is open-source operating system software, which means it can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. There are many different distributions (versions) of Linux, referred to as flavors, including Linux Mint, Mandrake, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS. In addition to the desktop operating systems, many distributions of Linux are designed for servers.

Operating Systems for mobile devices

Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, run operating systems designed specifically for the device.  Examples include:

Google Android. Android is a mobile operating system that is open-sourced, which allows original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to customize the Android source code to fit their devices. At the time of this writing, this mobile operating system has the largest user base.
Apple iOS. This is the mobile operating system developed by Apple for use on proprietary Apple hardware. Apple regulates all mobile apps and services that can run on iOS.
Utility Software

Utility software extends the capabilities of an operating system. Utility software helps customize the operating system's function. For example, installation utility software consists of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installation but not included in the operating system. Some examples of utility software include software to compress or decompress data, play multimedia presentations, and handle network communications.

Kernel

The kernel is the internal part of an operating system. The kernel contains the operating system components that perform the basic functions required by the computer installation. One such unit is the file manager whose function is to coordinate the machine’s storage. The file manager maintains records of all the files stored in secondary storage, including where each file is stored, which users have access, and which portions of the storage are available for new files.</div>

Define operating system.
Explain how operating systems relate to application software.
List common operating systems.
User Interface

The user interface allows end users to communicate with the operating system. Command-line interfaces (CLIs) are a type of user interface that communicate with end users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor.

Contemporary operating systems have graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs allow end users to issue commands through input devices such as mouses, keyboards, or touch screens. On a touch screen, a user can directly manipulate icons with their finger or a stylus.

While the user interface is an important part of a machine’s functionality, it is only the intermediary between the end user and the operating system. The distinction between the user interface and the internal parts of the operating system is emphasized by the fact that some operating systems require the user to select an available interface according to their preferences.

To learn more about the development of the user interface, read “An Abridged History of UI.”

Operating Systems Users

An operating system is also tasked with protecting the computer’s resources from unauthorized users. When a computer is used by multiple people, each user is assigned their own account on the computer. A user account is a record within the operating system with information such as a name, password, and user privileges (e.g., administrator vs. standard user). The operating system uses this information during each log-in to control access to the system and resources.

Accounts are established by the administrator, whose account is often called a superuser or root account. When the end user supplies the proper credentials during the log-in procedure, the user is given access to the operating system. Administrators can alter settings, modify critical software packages, and perform other maintenance activities denied to other users.

Review these websites to learn more about how to identify the administrator and other users on your personal computer.

File managers are able to bundle files into directories or folders. Directories can be placed within other directories, resulting in a hierarchical file structure. The directory path tells a user where the file is located within the file system. Directory paths are often written as the folder names separated by slashes. For example, a job seeker saves their files in the Linux environment as /home/mei/JobSearch/MyResumes/MyCoverLetters. The figure below is a depiction of a Linux file structure.

Figure. File hierarchy displayed in Linux.
Description of Linux file hierarchy diagram.

Windows, in a similar hierarchical file structure, would appear much like the figure below.

Figure. File hierarchy displayed in Windows.
Description of Windows file hierarchy diagram.

There are some key differences in working with Windows and Linux file structures. In a Windows shell

a backward slash (\) is used to express directory paths;
Windows is not case sensitive when searching for files, which means capitalization is irrelevant;
Windows root directory is referred to by letter, commonly C drive; and
the user’s home directory is found within C:\Users.

In a Linux shell

a forward slash (/) is used to express directory paths;
Linux is case-sensitive;
the root directory in Linux is expressed as a single forward slash; and
most flavors of Linux place the home directory within the /home/.

Consider how you organize your computer files.

Read “10 Effective File Management Tips to Keep Your Files Organized and Secure (opens new tab)” and determine two of the tips you could use to better organize your files.

Memory Management

The memory manager is another component of an operating system’s kernel. The memory manager manages the system’s primary main memory. When a computer is performing a single task, managing the memory is minimal. When a computer is performing many tasks simultaneously, the duties of the memory manager are extensive. The memory manager needs to find and assign the main memory space for each of the processes and restrict the actions of each process to the memory space allocated to that program. When more main memory space is needed, the memory manager can create an illusion of additional space by rotating programs and data between the primary and secondary memory, a technique called paging. The additional memory space created in secondary memory by paging is referred to as virtual memory.

Device Drivers

The kernel of an operating system stores a collection of device drivers, software that communicates with controllers or other peripheral devices. Device drivers translate generic requests into the technical steps required to complete the task. Device drivers, sometimes referred to as middleware, facilitate the communication of hardware and software. A print driver needs to be installed if a user wants to send a document to the printer. A Bluetooth headphone driver is necessary if a user wants to listen to music on Bluetooth headphones. Some device drivers are installed automatically, while others would need to be downloaded and installed from the manufacturers' sites.</div>

Table. Selecting application software.

Local and Cloud Applications

Local applications are application software stored on individual computers. Local applications are mostly found on personal machines, as they are often impractical for large organizations.

Cloud computing delivers services, including computing, storage, databases, networks, software, analytics, and intelligence, thus offloading infrastructure resource requirements to the cloud service provider. Cloud applications, or cloud apps, are software units where cloud-based and local components work together to perform tasks.

Software Licensing

Microsoft and Apple require you to purchase a license to install their operating systems, whether it is for personal or business use. Further, it is closed-source, meaning they do not permit anyone to modify their operating system code. The operating system is developed by Microsoft and Apple. Linux, on the other hand, is open-source and collaborators work together from around the world. Open-source systems allow individuals and organizations to open and modify the operating system's kernel, the heart of the operating system.

Software Packing

Software can be packaged in various ways, including shareware, freeware, and public domain. Shareware is an application that can be installed as a trial limited by time and/or functionality. If the user decides to purchase the application or subscription, they then get the full functionality. Freeware is, as the term suggests, free. However, freeware and shareware are both protected by end-user license agreements (EULA) and copyright laws (where applicable). This is where freeware and shareware are differentiated from software in the public domain. Public domain software has no EULA and no intellectual property protections and is available for anyone to download and use at their own discretion. However, in the United States, a copyright gives an author of a software package the ability to prevent unauthorized duplication for at least 35 years. Other countries may have similar copyright laws. Generally, copyright protects the expression of a specific idea and original works of authorship—with the intent to secure fair return to the author for creative labor and to stimulate artistic creativity for general good (United States Patent and Trademark Office). Copyright is not applied for but is automatically obtained at the creation of the work.

Patents in software packaging primarily protect unique methods, algorithms, or processes embedded within software applications. While patents can safeguard specific innovative aspects, such as novel coding techniques or inventive functionalities, they often do not cover the entire software package. Patents aim to encourage innovation by granting exclusive rights for a limited time, enabling creators to control and benefit from their inventive contributions within the software realm. Patents also relate to hardware and hardware components. There are two types of patents that hardware can be classified by: utility patents and design patents. The United States Patent and Trademark Office describes these patents, stating, "In general terms, a 'utility patent' protects the way an article is used and works (35 U.S.C. 101), while a 'design patent' protects the way an article looks (35 U.S.C. 171)"). An example of a utility patent may be a unique design for a mechanical keyboard switch, while a design patent may include the specific aesthetics of a mobile phone. There are conditions that must be met to receive a patent.

Programming Languages and Machine Code

The word programming refers to writing programs, which are step-by-step instructions for the computer to perform an action. Software, mobile applications, desktop applications, and games are all programs that instruct the computer to perform certain tasks. While computers may be able to carry out certain tasks much faster than a human can, we still need to be able to communicate with them. However, they do not understand human language. Over the history of computing, we’ve developed numerous high-level programming languages that allow us to communicate with computers.

Programmers write computer programs using a high-level language that humans can understand. This is also called source code or programming language. Computers do not understand the more human-readable high-level languages. Computers only execute programs written in binary (i.e., 0's and 1's), which is also referred to as machine code or machine language.

For our code to be executed, we need to translate it into machine language.  Computer scientists have produced two main translation solutions: interpreters and compilers. Both compilers and interpreters are used to translate programs into machine code.

Compiler

A compiler translates source code into machine language. A compiler checks source code for errors before translating. If the source code is found to have errors, the compiler specifies the errors. Errors must be resolved (also known as debugged) before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code. C, C++, C#, and Java programs need compilers to execute.

Java, C++, C#, etc., are some commonly used high-level programming languages using a compiler for translation into machine code. Compiled languages are also known as programming languages. A compiler takes all instructions written in the program and translates it all at once into machine code. Errors are output after the compiling process is complete.

Interpreter

Interpreters translate and execute source code into machine language one line at a time. If the interpreter finds an error, the process is terminated at the statement containing the error and displays an error message. The error must be resolved before the interpreter continues to the next line. Interpreters convert instructions one statement at a time when the program is run. Perl and Python execute using interpreters.

Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby etc., are common interpreted or scripted languages using interpreters for translation into machine code.

One significant advantage of an interpreter is that you can run a single line of code and see its output, whereas, in the case of a compiler, you need first to compile the whole code and then run it after all errors are fixed.

Why should you study compilers and interpreters?

A great craftsman must understand their tools, and a programmer is no different. By understanding how a compiler translates your program into machine language, you will become more skilled at writing and debugging code. You can create tools for debugging and translating. Understanding how to use compilers and interpreters will help you be a better programmer.

Learning Objective
Define algorithm.

The mere term algorithm sounds complicated and somewhat intimidating, but an algorithm is simply a step-by-step formula outlining how to execute a task. If you have ever baked a cake, pie, or cookies, or followed a recipe to make a special entrée for family or friends, you have experienced a real-world example of an algorithm. An algorithm provides a specifically structured set of inputs (i.e., the steps of a recipe) required to produce a specific output (i.e., your cake, pie, cookies, or special entrée).

In the IT world, an algorithm is a set of well-organized, computer-implemented instructions that often result in a computation or the solution to a problem. These computations can be simple or quite complex, depending on what the need is. Algorithms are even at the very heart of machine learning, and you will learn more about algorithms in the Scripting and Programming Foundations course later in this program.

What Is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a mathematical method of solving problems both big and small. Though computers run algorithms constantly, humans can also solve problems with algorithms. Watch the following video to learn how algorithms can be used in seemingly simple situations and also complex ones.

<div class="content">Section 6 Overview

Database systems integrate the information stored and maintained by an organization. A database management system converts large amounts of data into a usable format to help users make business decisions. Databases are configured according to different paradigm and store various types of data. They organize the data so that database applications can use allowable operations to manipulate and transform it. Flat-file, relational, hierarchical, and object-oriented are some of the most common database models. Database administration is an important function in any organization that is dependent on one or more databases. Database administration refers to the whole set of activities that ensure all databases are highly available, secure, and scalable.

In this section, you will explore the different database architectures and the features of the data they store. You will explore the basic operations on data types and the major components of the database administration function in an organization.

Explain the importance of ensuring that data and information systems support business goals and processes.
Explain how data is organized in a database.

Management of Data

Mei is the database administrator at a medical office, and she supports the IT infrastructure. While the office has contracted with a third-party IT consultant firm to help maintain the office databases, database administration still represents a significant portion of Mei's responsibilities. Mei maintains the databases that store patient records, manage appointments, and register patient payments. Mei also oversees the upload of data in various insurance databases through web portals. She grants access to the databases for new employees and modifies employee access to resources as needed. She creates backups of the office’s databases in case the data needs to be repopulated.

Today’s technology allows for storing vast amounts of data. A database management system converts large amounts of data into a usable format to help users make business decisions.

Databases

Most databases—for example, relational databases—are multidimensional, allowing information to be accessed from various views through internal linking between entries. Traditional flat file systems are one-dimensional. Traditional files present information from a single point of view and do not interact with other files.

As computing evolved, applications were implemented as separate systems and collections of data. Payroll was processed using the payroll file, employee records were maintained by the personnel department, and inventory was managed via the inventory file. Much of the information required by an organization was duplicated throughout the company while related items were stored in separate systems. Database systems integrate the information stored and maintained by an organization. With such a system, the same employee data could be used to process payroll, calculate vacation days, and manage employee benefits. Users in logistics could use the same system to record inventory audits, restock orders, and report damaged goods.

Database Research

Database research is the act of analyzing and converting data into information that can be used in decision-making.

Database systems are the underlying technology that supports much of the World Wide Web. Websites interface between clients and databases, responding to client requests. Web servers search a database, organize the results in a web page, and send that page to the client.</div>

Database Management Systems

A typical database application has two major layers: an application layer and a database management layer. The application layer communicates with the end user and can be fairly complex. For example, when end users access a database through a website, the application layer consists of programs and services within a server that queries the database on behalf of the client.

The application layer of a database does not directly manipulate the data. After the application software receives a request from a user, it uses the database management system (DBMS) as a tool to obtain the results. If the request is to add or delete data to or from the system, the DBMS alters the database after receiving the request through the application layer. If the request is to retrieve information, it is the DBMS that performs the required searches.

The DBMS is similar to an operating system in that it supports the application software and the data.

Learn more about database management systems by accessing a free version of Microsoft Access or OpenOffice Base.

A database table is composed of records and fields that hold data. For more information, do a bit of research on such benefits and weaknesses of Microsoft Access.

Database Elements

A database table, also known as a datasheet, is composed of records and fields that hold data. Data is stored in records. The records are represented as rows in a table with related information. The example table below has three records storing data for three different employees.

The columns represent fields. A field contains a single piece of data about the subject of a record. The five fields in the example table are First Name, Last Name, Age, Position, and Years in Position.

Explain how data is organized in a database.
Flat-File Databases

A DBMS contains routines that translate commands into the actions required by the actual data storage system. This conceptual view of the database is called a database model. Flat-file, relational, hierarchical, and object-oriented are some of the most common database models.

A flat-file database stores data in a plain text file. Each line of the text file holds one record. Fields are separated by delimiters like spaces or commas. Because a flat database uses a simple structure, it cannot contain multiple tables.

Figure. An example of a flat database.
Description of flat-file database screenshot.

Operations that can be performed on a flat-file database include creating, deleting, and updating records, and searching the entire file for records meeting given criteria.

What would a flat-file database of your immediate family’s email addresses look like?

Hierarchical Databases

The hierarchical database is one of the oldest database models. Data is organized in a tree structure, much like an organizational chart. There is one parent for each record, with optional nodes, forming sub-trees called segments. Access to the data is predictable and restricted to the paths in the trees.

Description of Relation Table.

Relational databases contain database tables that can be joined together in logical ways. Because data is stored in relational tables, each record has a unique identifier, such as a product identification number or user name. This unique identifier, referred to as a primary key, creates the relationship among tables. A field may be marked as the primary key on one table but also be found on another table. When this happens, a relationship called a foreign key is created. 

The role of some attributes is to interrelate tables in a way that establishes meaningful relationships relating to their real-world interactions.

Identify basic structured query language (SQL) commands.
Explain how data is organized in a database.

The database operation is an activity through which users and applications access and manipulate data in relational databases. When users or applications send requests (known as queries) to a database, the result is found and sent back as a response to the origination of the request. Structured query language (SQL) code includes queries to identify what data should be retrieved or how the data should be manipulated. The DBMS complements the SQL code by providing a mechanism to send the code to and from the database server.

Selection Operation

The selection operation takes rows from one table and creates a new table. The user specifies the table from which the rows are taken and tests the selection criterion. The selection criterion is tested against each row, and when a condition is met, that row is included in the result table. Tests use attribute names, constants, and relational operators, such as AND and OR, which define the criteria. In this example, the syntax is searching for the patient record with the patient ID ‘223344.’:

SELECT * FROM Patient
WHERE PatientID = ‘223344’;

The SELECT statement identifies the records that are being requested, and the asterisk (*) means everything from that table. The parameter after FROM identifies the table name (Patient). The next keyword, WHERE, is the condition the query is requesting.

Union Operations

The union operation combines distinct fields from multiple tables that have the same set of attributes and data types. For example, if one column accepts integers and another accepts variable characters, they would not be compatible for a union.

SELECT PatientID, LastName FROM Patient
UNION 
SELECT NurseID, LastName FROM Nurse;


Table. UNION operation results.
Description of Results

Product Operation

The product operation creates a result table that includes all of the attributes from the two tables; each row of the second table is added to each row of the first table.

SELECT Shifts.WingSegment, Shifts.Shift, NurseName.LastName

FROM Shifts

CROSS JOIN NurseName;

Notice when you are using more than one table as a source, the table name precedes the attribute name, separated by a period. Shifts.WingSegment refers to the field ‘WingSegment’ from the table ‘Shifts.’

Description of Results

 

The result table from a product operation might not answer specific logical questions, but the combined tables allow other operations to answer more powerful questions relating to data from the two separate tables.

Join Operation

A join operation combines two tables, but records are only appended when a matching criterion is met. The result table includes a row with the attributes of both tables only when attributes from the first database table match related attributes from the second database table.

SELECT*
FROM Patient, Nurse;

This syntax selects all the fields from both ‘Patient’ and ‘Nurse’ tables, and joins them into one large table. This is referred to as an implicit join. Alternatively, to get the same results, an explicit join can be used as shown below.

SELECT*
FROM Patient CROSS JOIN Nurse;
Figure. Join operation result.
Description of Results

There are three tables shown in this diagram. The first is labeled Patient. It contains four rows. The first row is the header row. The field names given in the header row are Patient ID, First Name, Last Name, and DOB. The first row of results lists patient ID 112233, first name Tim, last name Stark, DOB 01/03/1978. The second row of results lists patient ID 223344, first name Wyoming, last name Maximoff, DOB 03/12/1982. The third and final row of results lists patient ID 334455, firstname Bruce, last name Lei, DOB 04/18/1975.

The second table is labeled Nurse. It contains three rows. The first row is the header row. The field names given in the header row are Nurse ID, First Name, Last Name, and Station. The first row of results lists nurse ID 2345, first name Christina, last name Lee, station intensive care. The second row of results lists nurse ID 3456, first name Ivan, last name Petroff, station maternity. The third and final row of results lists nurse ID 4567, firstname Zhang, last name Wei, station recovery.

The JOIN query results in a third table that is not given a name in the diagram. Instead, two green arrows point to this table, one each from the Patient and Nurse tables. This table contains four rows. The first row is the header row. The field names given in the header row look like those from the Patient and Nurse tables, but each field is appended with a dot and the name of the table from which the field came. Thus, the header row reads Patient ID dot patient, First Name dot patient, Last Name dot patient, DOB dot patient, Nurse ID dot nurse, First Name dot nurse, Last Name dot nurse, and Station dot nurse. The three subsequent rows list the three patient IDs with their associated last names and the three nurse IDs with their associated last names. The results show that Stark's nurse is Lee, Maximoff's is Petroff, and Lei's is Wei.</div>

More Databases

In contrast to relational databases, object-oriented (OO) databases (also referred to as object databases) store complex data and relationships between data directly without using inter-table relations. An object database is a collection of objects, each with two components: data and instructions. The instructions, or software programs called methods, define what to do with the data in the object.

Description of object diagram

NoSQL Databases

In key-value databases (also referred to as stores), each item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or key) together with its value. Graph stores are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. Wide-column stores are optimized for queries on large data sets and store columns of data together, instead of in rows. Document-format databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs.

NoSQL, which is short for not only SQL, databases can accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph formats. NoSQL is an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables that are carefully designed before the database is built. NoSQL databases are especially useful for working with large sets of distributed data.

Review the “All in the NoSQL Family (opens new tab)” graphic to learn more about the different types of NoSQL databases.

Cloud Databases

Cloud databases are optimized to work in a cloud environment. Some practical benefits include the ability to increase resources to accommodate for demands on the system, to be highly available even in the case of local or regional outages, and to support SaaS (software as a service) cloud deployments.

Data Lakes

A data lake is a system of data stored in raw format. It is usually a single store of all enterprise data as well as information derived from data during reporting, transactions, or other activities. Data lakes can include both structured data, such as tables, and unstructured data, such as audio and video recordings.

Distributed Databases

With the advancement of networking capabilities, database systems have grown to include what is now known as a distributed database. A distributed database consists of data residing on different machines. For instance, an international corporation might store and maintain local employer records at local sites, yet link those records via a network to create a single, distributed database.</div>

Database Administration

Database management and administration are important functions in any organization that is dependent on one or more databases. It refers to the whole set of activities that ensure all databases are highly available, secure, and scalable. Scalability is the ability to accommodate increased demands while using existing resources (e.g., increasing memory capacity before being fully exhausted).

DBA Responsibilities

A majority of the database administration (DBA) responsibilities fall into these categories:

Database security—ensuring that only authorized users have access to the database and fortifying it against unauthorized access
Database tuning—optimizing performance of database systems
High availability—making replicas (copies) of databases available from various locations; if one copy is unavailable due to outage, the alternate location can continue database services
Business continuity—continuing core business operations effectively, even with the disruption of some auxiliary services
Backup and recovery—planning for and executing adequate backup and recovery procedures
Reporting—writing complex queries and generating reports for users
Designing and developing database applications—writing code to interact with the database resources

The DBA needs a complex set of specialized skills, as well as current knowledge of database developments, acquired through intense professional development.</div>

<div class="content">Section 7 Overview

Information technology is a large part of the day-to-day operations of almost all functioning organizations. IT governance is the system of processes that ensures the effective and efficient use of IT to enable an organization to achieve its business goals and to add value to key stakeholders in an organization. To organize projects in the IT domain, organizations follow project management methodologies to guide them to completion. Specific methodologies for developing software, such as the software development life cycle, are being adopted by virtually all development teams to manage the intricacies of complex software and the multiple people who work on or with it. Project management frameworks ensure that projects are well defined with clear, attainable goals and that resources are in place for successful completion.

Companies quickly adopt new technologies in an effort to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Computing professionals need to monitor such emerging developments.

Describe IT departments’ internal organization and job roles within an IT department.

The medical office where Mei works employs one IT professional and contracts with third parties for complex IT functions. Mei shares the needs of the office with the contractors and monitors their work. The medical office works with a healthcare informatics company in the next state, and Mei communicates with them throughout the workday. Each night, the data from the offices’ various systems are copied onto magnetic tapes so that any lost data can be recovered in a reasonable amount of time.

Information technology is a large part of the day-to-day operations of almost all functioning organizations. Computers are used to store, recover, transmit, process, and secure all forms of data and information. Due to their reliance on technology and data, many companies are known as "digital enterprises." The organizational function of IT is to support any technology used to assist in solving business and organizational problems. Specifically, IT functions cover five different domains:

communication
data collection and management
information security management
consumer relationship management
process improvement

Communication has always been an important part of any business. IT, however, has redefined the way we communicate with each other. IT enables organizations to communicate by phone, email, video conferencing, social media, and many other ways. Perhaps more significantly, the rise of social media has changed how companies communicate with their customers. Companies use social media for advertising and customer service, talking with customers in a way that makes them feel more connected with the brand.

IT systems allow an organization to collect, store, manage, and use vast amounts of information. IT tools take raw data and convert it into information for analysis.

The IT department also keeps the company's data secure. Not only can data leaks lead to fines and regulatory action but they can also damage an organization's reputation and business.

IT is being used to improve how organizations interact with their customers. Specifically, customer relationship management systems (CRMs) track and organize every interaction a company has with current and potential customers, providing data about customers’ needs, wants, and behaviors.

IT is responsible for designing and implementing tools to improve efficiency. Implementing technologies that automate processes can reduce repetitive human labor and human error.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Explain the purpose of an IT department in an organization.
Identify the reasons for aligning IT goals to the business mission and goals.
Describe IT departments’ internal organization and job roles within an IT department.
Explain the importance of maintaining business and process continuity.
Identify opportunities for buying vs. building a solution in-house, as well as insourcing vs. outsourcing.
Describe user needs and other information systems requirements, including security and accessibility functions.

Mei manages the IT infrastructure of the medical office. The work that she does must align with the mission, vision, and goals of the medical office.

The organizational vision is

“To be a leading local healthcare services provider dedicated to advancing the health of the people we serve through quality, accessible, and patient-centered service.”

The mission is

“To provide compassionate, accessible, and cost-effective healthcare to the community. Advancement, inclusiveness, respect, and responsibility are adopted as the company’s core values.”

The IT department is an organizational subsystem made up of skilled technology specialists working together to support the technological infrastructure of the company. The roles within the IT department collectively manage IT activities that align with the organization’s strategic, tactical, and operational goals. IT departments interact with both internal and external clients. The marketing department is the IT department’s internal client when it requests data about the average time it takes for patients to check in and check out of the emergency room. The IT department may also collaborate with external clients, such as troubleshooting a patient’s ability to log in to their medical patient portal on their app.

Strategic goals are long-term, organizational aspirations determined by management that detail things such as eventual service and product offerings and social and economic impacts. Management uses tactical planning to develop short-term plans for how to operate with maximum efficiency; operational planning is much like tactical planning, except operational plans are long term.

IT governance is the system of processes that ensures the effective and efficient use of IT to enable an organization to achieve its business goals and to add value to key stakeholders in an organization. This governance provides the company's IT function with strategic management, realizations of benefits to the organization, risk optimization, and resource optimization. In addition, it supports the company's compliance with regulations and supports initiatives for competitive advantages, the company's growth and innovation, an increase of assets, and the reduction of risks. 

As an organizational system, an IT department should have a clearly defined vision, mission, and set of core values that define its own strategic, tactical, and operational goals for supporting the organization. The vision states what the department would like to achieve, the mission states how they will achieve the vision, and the core values state expected behaviors. The vision, mission, and objectives of the IT department should closely align with the vision, mission, and objectives of the organization.

IT Job Functions

Some organizations use the outsourcing model, keeping a core IT department to manage the operations and work with one or more third-party service providers. The third-party service providers do the needed technical work. IT employees manage the work of third parties, ensuring it is done according to specifications and requirements and acting as business analysts and project managers.

Several job functions are typical in an IT department, whether employed internally or externally contracted:

Network administrators set up, maintain, and monitor the hardware and software that support the networking components of the computer systems.
Systems administrators set up, maintain, and monitor devices that support business operations. These devices include anything from projectors and smartboards in a training room to the devices in the server room.
Web administrators control the outward-facing content on an organization’s website and intranets and ensure that the sites function and integrate with back-end systems, such as supporting databases.
Database administrators configure and troubleshoot an organization’s data repositories.
Cybersecurity analysts monitor the behaviors of the system components for anomalies and malicious attacks. They also put measures in place to deter, detect, and mitigate internal and external threats.
Technical support specialists provide end-user training and help users resolve issues accessing resources and systems.

Larger IT departments may include special-purpose teams within the IT departments. For example, an organization might have a team of cloud engineers dedicated to supporting cloud applications and virtual storage or a reporting team that maintains systems that generate reports. Typically, system administrators and network administrators in large organizations also have dedicated responsibilities. Systems administrators focus on things like user and device support. Network administrators focus on things like network device and server management. In small to medium-sized organizations, IT roles often blend responsibilities. In small organizations, it is common for the network and system administrator roles to be performed by a single person.

In addition to technical roles, organizations use managerial and leadership oversight roles in IT that may include functional managers, chief information officers (CIO), and chief information security officers (CISO). In addition, general managerial and leadership functions also provide direction to the IT function.

Organizational Models for the IT Function

Outsourcing uses the resources and skills of a developed workforce from an external organization. Hiring an organization that specializes in particular services is beneficial, as companies cannot always justify employing specialists with narrow skill sets. Outsourcing can improve efficiency and productivity, while also helping an organization save money. Third-party organizations are experienced in areas in which the current staff would otherwise need additional lead time for training. Also, outsourcing allows internal staff to be more productive in core business functions as the contracted organization focuses on auxiliary tasks. When an organization does decide to outsource a task or project, the first step should always be to consult with the potential third-party provider, often referred to as a vendor, and request a demonstration (demo) of the proposed solution.

Multiple outsourcing modalities include offshoring, outsourcing outside country lines; project outsourcing, where project management is outsourced; and nearshoring, offshoring to countries in a closer time zone or with an economic structure close to that of the home country.

Insourcing assigns a project to employees within the organization. Insourcing generally requires the development of new operations and processes, making it an expensive option.

An organization's control over operations and decisions differs depending on whether the organization is outsourcing or insourcing.

Consider the advantages and disadvantages of the three outsourcing models described above. Have you ever worked for an organization that outsourced any of its IT functions? If so, think about how effective that model was.</div>

Describe the characteristics of a project and identify its phases.

The Project Management Life Cycle

The medical office is considering hiring an outside company to help Mei implement a new electronic health record system. Mei equates this project to being asked to design and supervise the construction of a house. How can she estimate the cost, time, and other resources necessary to complete the project? How can she divide the project into manageable phases? How can she ensure compatibility among the parts? What would be reasonable milestones? Mei knows that questions like these must be answered during the development of the new information system.

PM Life Cycle Model

A project is a purpose-driven event that has a defined start and finish. Project management frameworks ensure that projects are well defined, with clear, attainable goals, and that resources are in place for successful completion.

Figure. Sample project management life cycle model.
Description of Project Management Life Cycle Diagram.

The project management life cycle is represented differently in various models, but projects generally include four phases: initiation, planning, execution, and closure.

Project Initiation

Project initiation broadly defines the project. It usually begins with a business case, followed by a feasibility study. During the feasibility study, research assesses whether the business case will lead to a reasonable, feasible solution. Project stakeholders provide input in the analysis of the business case, resulting in a project charter, or project initiation document, that outlines the business needs, the stakeholders, and the business case.

Project Planning

Project planning includes developing a road map that everyone follows. This phase starts with setting the project goals, commonly using the SMART or CLEAR frameworks, both of which are described below.

SMART Framework
Specific	Set a specific goal that answers the questions who, what, where, when, which, and why.
Measurable	Create criteria that can be used to measure the success of the goal.
Attainable	Ensure the goal is attainable given the resources.
Realistic	Assess the willingness to work toward the goal.
Timely	The goal should be achievable within the available timeframe.
Source: Attributes of a SMART goal: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/others/smart-goal/

CLEAR Framework
Collaborative	The goal should encourage employees to work together.
Limited	The goal should be limited in scope and time to keep it manageable.
Emotional	The goal should tap into the passion of employees and be something they can form an emotional connection to. This can optimize the quality of work.
Appreciable	Break larger goals into smaller tasks that can be quickly achieved.
Refinable	As new situations arise, be flexible and refine the goal as needed.
Source: Attributes of a CLEAR goal: https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/forget-smart-goals-try-clear-goals-instead.html

Project planning defines the project scope and drafts a project management plan. The project management plan identifies project resources, including cost and time estimations. A project generally has each of the following documents by the end of the planning phase:

scope statement outlining the objectives, deliverables, and milestones
work breakdown structure (WBS) breaking the project into manageable segments for the team
milestones defining high-level goals to meet throughout the project’s duration
communication plan outlining the frequency and methods of communicating with stakeholders
risk management plan identifying foreseeable risks, including cost overruns and delays

Project Execution

During project execution, project deliverables are developed and completed. A kickoff meeting usually marks the start of this phase. Tasks typically include developing the project team, assigning resources, setting up tracking systems, conducting status meetings, and monitoring the project timetable.

Project performance is constantly observed during the execution phase. Key performance indicators, or metrics, are used to monitor the progress of the project, determining whether the project is on track to meet the defined milestones.

Project Closure

At the project closure phase, the project is declared complete and the project team is dissolved. Project managers complete the final project documentation, including financial reports. Generally, meetings are also a part of this phase, allowing members of the project team to reflect on strengths and opportunities for improvement.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Define project initiation, risk and business impact analysis, risk mitigation, and control.
List tools supporting protection and risk management.
Define scope creep.

Risks in execution, risks in integration, and risks of the unknown are three broad categories of risks a project may encounter. These risks need to be considered during project planning and monitored during project execution to minimize their effect on project completion.

Considering risks during the project planning phase includes several steps:

Identify the risks
Analyze their impact on the project outcome
Prioritize the risks by severity and likelihood
Outline a mitigation strategy to minimize potential risks
Install monitoring systems for anticipated and unanticipated risks

Risks in execution typically revolve around budget, people, technology, equipment, and stakeholder support. Issues that can deem a project unsuccessful include cost overrun, insufficient staff, inadequate tools to support the project, and lack of support from project stakeholders. Planning in advance is one of the best ways to mitigate risks of execution.

The outcome of a project will likely affect other systems and processes in an organization. Risks of integration can be mitigated by assessing potential disruptions, ensuring adequate support from stakeholders, and having a shared understanding of the project’s complexity.

Two key strategies to successfully identify risks are frequent monitoring of project parameters and milestones and sound communication between project participants.

Project risks take many forms and emerge for different reasons. Some of the most common examples of project risks are listed here:

Scope creep—uncontrolled change of a project’s scope, typically adding tasks and increased, unplanned costs to the project
Budget risk—budget control issues, such as underestimated or improper allocation of cost
Resistance to change—departments and individuals resist organizational changes resulting from the project
Resource risk—inability to secure sufficient resources for the project
Contract risk—a vendor fails to deliver on contractual obligations
Disputes or disagreements between project participants
Project dependencies—especially when completion of some tasks is dependent on the completion of other tasks
Project assumptions risk—when assumptions about the project are invalidated during project development
Benefit shortfall—the project meets the requirements but delivers fewer benefits than outlined in the business case
Requirements quality risk—requirements have not been properly validated or documented
Force majeure risk—the chance of a major negative event beyond human control, such as a natural disaster</div>

Mei’s office is implementing a new electronic system for patient health records. They have not decided yet whether the system will be developed for the office or they will buy an off-the-shelf solution and configure it to their needs. To begin the initiative, Mei needs to specify the requirements for the new system. She has scheduled interviews with the company’s employees and leadership and developed questionnaires for the patients. She has also set up several workshops to disseminate the preliminary findings and gather more input. Mei plans to refine the requirements using brainstorming, role-playing, user observation, and use-case scenarios. Next, she will develop a prototype to validate the requirements. This is not the first time she has worked on a system development project; she knows specifying the requirements is the beginning of a complex multiphase process.

System Development

Computer system engineers use principles to guide the development of large, complex information systems. The development of these systems requires multiple employees over an extended period. It is also common for system and staffing requirements to change, adding more time to the project. While off-the-shelf products work for many tasks, they are not always a feasible solution. Unlike other fields of engineering, building information systems lack quantitative data for analysis, or metrics, for measuring the properties of the information systems.

Case

Many methodologies used in the past have been replaced. Overcoming engineering issues related to computer systems, including the lack of metrics and prefabricated systems, leads to progress. Developing software that can collect and analyze every aspect of the software development life cycle (SDLC), led to the computer-aided software engineering (CASE) domain of software development:

project planning, project scheduling, and personnel allocation
documentation tools to assist in writing, organizing, and managing documents
interface design tools to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
programming tools to assist in writing and debugging code

Integrated development environments (IDEs) combine tools, such as editing, compiling, and debugging tools, into a single package. A few examples of IDEs that help users develop smartphone applications include Appery.io, TheAppBuilder, and AppMachine. Such programs provide the programming tools needed to write and debug the apps as well as a graphical display to simulate the application's interface and performance.

Organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) provide guidelines for developing integrated systems and establish standards for measuring the quality of system and software development.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Describe the process of system deployment and integration with existing systems.
Define project initiation, risk and business impact analysis, risk mitigation, and control.
Describe the characteristics of a project and identify its phases.
Describe user needs and other information systems requirements, including security and accessibility functions.

The goal of the requirements analysis is to determine what services the system will provide, identify any conditions (such as time constraints and security), and define how users will interact with the system.

What methods did Mei use for gathering requirements?

Requirements analysis requires significant input from stakeholders, such as potential users, as well as those with other ties, such as legal or financial interests. In cases where the beneficiary is an entity, like a company or government agency, requirements analysis may start with a feasibility study. The feasibility study determines whether development is possible under the given constraints and whether the development aligns with the organization’s mission. In the case of producing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems for the mass market, requirements analysis is likely to begin with a market study by the system developer.

The requirements analysis process consists of three steps:

Compiling and analyzing the needs of the system use
Negotiating with project stakeholders on trade-offs between wants, needs, costs, and feasibility
Developing a set of requirements identifying the necessary features and services of the completed system

The system requirement specification (SRS) is a written agreement between all parties that records the system requirements and guides system development. The SRS also helps resolve disputes that arise during development. Because of how important the SRS is in the development process, organizations such as IEEE and large systems clients, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, have adopted standards for requirement specifications.

The SRS should clearly define objectives to determine a system’s success. Too often, however, the SRS fails to delineate the system objectives.

While the requirements analysis describes the system, the design creates a plan for constructing the system. Requirements analysis identifies the problem to be solved, while design plans a solution. Requirements analysis is often equated with deciding what the system should do, whereas design is equated with deciding how the system would do it. If, for example, the user’s ability to access necessary systems using a limited number of steps is defined as a user requirement, the design phase may include the layout of drop-down boxes and the coloring scheme. When the design phase is complete, the organization should have a detailed description of the system structure.

Implementation and Integration

The system is built during the implementation phase, including such things as developing programs and databases and creating data files. As projects move from the design phase into the implementation phase, the demand for specialized technical skills increases. It is during the implementation stage of software development projects, for example, that the distinction between a system analyst and a programmer becomes clear. A system analyst is involved throughout the entire development process. A programmer is primarily tasked with writing programs that implement the design produced by a system analyst.

Many factors influence the successful implementation of a system—training, team skills, team communication, effective project management, quality assurance, and upper-management commitment are just a few.

System Maintenance

During system maintenance, the system is monitored, evaluated, and modified as needed. System maintenance is a continuous phase that covers a wide variety of activities, including troubleshooting application errors and incompatibilities, updating documentation, and providing end-user support. There are four primary categories of software maintenance: corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive.

The goal of corrective maintenance is to remove errors to ensure functionality of the system. In Mei’s medical office, if a patient record application causes the operating system to reboot, Mei might begin corrective maintenance by reviewing the application and/or operating system logs.

Adaptive maintenance is performed when organizational changes affect system requirements, such as changes in the organizational procedures, forms, or system controls and security needs. For example, Mei’s medical office might change how nurses obtain and verify their patients’ identity, such as adding barcode reader functionality to read barcodes from patients' wristbands.

Perfective maintenance is performed when new components are introduced, or existing components are improved, to enhance overall system performance. Examples of perfective maintenance include a new operating system for performance improvement or a new technology to increase efficiency.

Preventive maintenance refers to changes made to increase the life span of systems and could include restructuring, optimizing code, or updating documentation that impacts the scalability, stability, and maintainability of the system. One maintenance activity that could be categorized as preventative is testing air conditioning units in the server rooms.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Identify the different types of testing.
Describe user needs and other information systems requirements, including security and accessibility functions.

As systems have become more complex, malfunctions, cost overruns, and missed deadlines are becoming more common, resulting in a need for more effective quality control processes. System quality control goes beyond debugging to include improving procedures and developing training for employees. The ISO 9000 series of standards address industrial activities such as design, production, installation, and servicing. The ISO/IEC 15504 is a set of standards developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It is common for third-party system developers to meet specific standards.

Quality control must also maintain effective documentation practices. It is important that each step of the development process is accurately documented for future reference. Without maintaining up-to-date documentation, it is likely the records will be inaccurate or no longer applicable. Documenting the various audits throughout the system development process helps reduce errors.

Testing

In the past, testing was primarily the process of checking systems and confirming that the final product was compatible with the system requirement specification. Now, testing is only one part of quality assurance. Systems are not the only artifacts that are tested during the system development process. The result of each intermediate step in the entire development process is also tested for accuracy. Many system engineers believe that testing should be incorporated into the other steps of the development process, creating a three-step development process:

Requirements analysis and confirmation
Design and validation
Implementation and testing

Unfortunately, even with modern quality assurance techniques, large systems continue to contain errors. Even after significant testing periods, many errors go undetected for the life of the system, while other errors cause major malfunctions. Reducing these errors is one of the goals of system engineering.

Systems need thorough testing to ensure that functionality and performance requirements are met. System engineers have developed testing methodologies to improve the ability to identify errors with a limited number of tests. The Pareto principle is based on the theory that 80% of errors come from 20% of the system, meaning most errors can be identified by testing carefully selected groups of samples. Basis path testing is another software testing methodology. Basis path testing develops a set of test data that ensures each instruction in the software is executed at least once.

Techniques based on the Pareto principle and basis path testing rely on knowledge of a system's internal components. This is known as glass-box testing, commonly referred to as white-box testing, which includes having developers test internal structures of software. Black-box testing does not rely on the tester's knowledge of the system's structure but is focused on the user experience (UX).

Methodologies that fall within the black-box category are alpha, beta, and user acceptance testing. In alpha testing, the first stage, developers and/or an internal UX team test a preliminary version of the software, providing feedback about performance and functionality. The second stage is beta testing, sometimes referred to as pilot testing. In this stage, the next version of the system is given to a segment of end users for similar testing from their perspective before the final version is released. The final stage is referred to as user acceptance testing. During this stage, the users test the system in an operational setting to make sure the system continues to align with business objectives and meet the goals of the stakeholders.

Documentation

A system is not effective unless people can learn to use it and maintain it properly. Documentation is an important part of a system. The production of documentation is a component of the system development process. There are three types of system documentation: user documentation, system documentation, and technical documentation. User documentation explains the system to users and may include information such as how to access certain features, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and contact information for customer support.

System documentation describes the system's internal configuration so the system can be maintained later in its life cycle. A major part of software development system documentation is software code. The code needs to be versioned and presented in a readable format. Versioned code allows developers to track modifications and reverse any changes that have been problematic. Readability is important so that any contributing developer can read the code. Development companies have created conventions for writing programs that include several common features:

indentation conventions for script readability
naming conventions for variables and constraints
documentation conventions for sufficient program documentation

Technical documentation describes how to install and maintain the system, including information about installing updates and providing feedback to the development team.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Define project initiation, risk and business impact analysis, risk mitigation, and control.
Identify the different types of testing.

Early approaches to system engineering used the waterfall model, following the development process sequentially: first requirements analysis, then design and implementation, and finally testing. Each step needed to be finished before moving on to the next. New models have evolved to reflect the natural trial-and-error creative process of problem-solving. Using the incremental model, the system is constructed in increments. The first increment is a simplified version of the final product. As tests are completed, more features are added and tested incrementally until the system is complete. If a patient record system is being developed for a hospital, the first increment might incorporate only the ability to view a small sample of patient records. Additional features would be available when this version is operational, such as the ability to add and update records.

Prototyping is building and evaluating basic versions of a proposed system. Rapid prototyping involves quickly constructing a simple sample that may consist of only a few screen images, indicating how the system would function. Rapid prototyping is used to build a "rough draft" of a product, with minimal resources and effort, giving stakeholders a clear picture of the intended system.

Open-source development permits users to modify the software code. Possibly the most notable example is the Linux operating system. Although most software from Microsoft is closed source (meaning the code cannot be modified), PowerShell Core was made open source in 2016. Under the open-source model, applications are developed and shared to be downloaded, used, and updated by a local or even global community of enthusiasts.

Agile Methodologies

Agile methods are system development methodologies that propose incremental implementations, respond to rapidly changing requirements, and reduce the emphasis on rigorous requirements. Scrum and extreme programming are both examples of agile methodologies.

Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple steps:

The system owner makes a prioritized wish list.
The scrum team selects an item toward the top of the wish list and plans the implementation during an event called "sprint."
The team completes the list of objectives while assessing progress in daily meetings called scrums.
The sprint ends with the system ready to be released.
A new sprint starts, using another item on the wish list.
This process continues until the prioritized wish list is clear.

Following the extreme programming (XP) model, systems are developed by a team of fewer than a dozen individuals working in a communal workspace, where they freely share ideas and assist each other in the development project. The system is developed incrementally by repeated daily cycles of informal requirements analyses, designs, and common tests. New, expanded versions of the system appear on a regular basis. Each version is usually evaluated by the project stakeholders.

Agile development is quick, increases customer satisfaction, values employees, and reduces rework.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objective
Explain the importance of maintaining business and process continuity.

One of IT's many important roles is ensuring the core organizational activities execute as planned and that disaster recovery and business continuity plans are in place to limit the risk and impact of disruptions and catastrophic events. In most industries, organizations are required by various contracts and regulatory bodies to have a contingency plan in place and to continuously test and revise contingency plans. Another common requirement for regulated industries is uptime, the amount of time client data and resources are available on the servers. Availability is often measured in the number of nines (including the whole number) found in a percentage. For example, if an organization is required to have 99.999% uptime, it is stated as "five nines." This means the organization is required to have an average of less than approximately three seconds of downtime per week.

High availability solutions provide replicas, or copies, of critical systems that can be deployed when the original systems are not available.

Disaster recovery plans (DRPs) rely on solutions to ensure that systems can recover from catastrophic events in a reasonable amount of time with minimal data loss.

When disruptions do occur, business continuity plans help define how to resume services to customers and vital business operations, while auxiliary services may remain offline. While these conditions are not ideal, such plans allow the business to operate with limited resources until services are fully restored.

Data mirroring, data backups, and off-site storage are some of the strategies used for disaster recovery and business continuity. Data mirroring involves setting up the operating system to simultaneously write copies of the data on several storage devices. If something happens to one drive, another drive will be used in place of the faulty one, enabling the systems to recover functionality quickly without significant degradation of service. Data backups can be stored on any data storage device, but tape archival is common for businesses. Tape drives are inexpensive and can be transported to an off-site location. Off-site locations are a common solution for disaster recovery; if the primary site is damaged in some way, the data can likely be restored at another site.

Off-site storage locations are often found in other states. Salt mines and caves are popular locations for physical storage because of the low humidity and the protection provided by the earth's terrain. Storing data in the cloud is another popular option. Storing a copy of company data in the cloud improves the ability to recover, as many public cloud service providers replicate their data across various geographic locations.

Suggested Criteria for Assessing Off-Site Storage
Accessibility	The length of time necessary to retrieve the data from storage. Also, the storage facility’s opening hours.
Cost	The cost of shipping, operational fees, and disaster response/recovery services.
Environment	The structural and environmental conditions of the storage facility: temperature, humidity, fire prevention, and power management control.
Geographic area	The distance from the organization. The probability of the storage site being affected by the same adverse event as the organization.
Security	The security capabilities of the storage facility and employee confidentiality. Both the storage facility and employee confidentiality must meet the data's sensitivity and security requirements.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

IT professionals often refer to storage as hot or cold. The key difference is that the hotter the storage solution is, the quicker an organization's data can be retrieved and normal IT operations can resume after a disaster.

Hot storage	Hot storage allows organizations the quickest access to restore critical data in the event of a disaster or catastrophe. Hot storage solutions typically involve the latest and greatest storage equipment and the fastest protocols. In addition, hot storage is typically located close to the client or in multiple locations to ensure fast access. Some hot data storage solutions include Microsoft’s Azure Hot Blobs and Amazon's AWS service, but these premium solutions can be quite expensive because of the high-performing resources and protocols involved.
Cold storage	Cold storage offers less frequent access and is maintained on minimal equipment that is considered lower performance. Returning to normal operations after a disaster is slower with cold storage. Some examples of cold storage include tape backup, offline cloud storage, and even some online services such as Amazon Glacier and Google Coldline. One significant advantage of cold storage, however, is that it is less expensive than hot storage.</div>

Explain ITs role in globalization and globalization’s role in IT.
Identify current and emerging information technologies and their applications.

Mei’s personal professional mission is to support the medical office in providing infrastructural solutions that patients enjoy. The patients’ preferences change often, especially when new technologies become widely adopted. Therefore, Mei constantly attends training on various relevant technologies that may be beneficial and follows professional literature to stay aware of all the emerging technologies.

Mobile Computing

Mobile computing is the use of handheld devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Due to the miniaturization of hardware, mobile devices are approaching the computational capabilities and speed of larger computing systems, while continuously decreasing in size. The popularity of mobile computing devices continues to increase the demand for infrastructures that adequately support these needs.

The Internet of Things (IoT)

Embedded and mechanical devices, objects, animals, and people are increasingly being provided with unique identifiers (UIDs), which provides the ability to transfer data, or even funds, via a network without the need for direct human interaction. This system of interconnected devices is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart home devices, wearables, and connected cars are examples of IoT devices. These items rely heavily on sensors and network infrastructures to acquire and transmit data and possibly generate more new data. IoT is a notable emerging trend in IT because these devices can be attached to nearly anything and become components of a larger system.

Globalization

The IT revolution is changing the way we communicate and process data and affecting the way we live, work, and play.

Globalization refers to the growing interdependence of the world’s economies and cultures, brought about by the trade of goods and services and the flow of information and people. Advancements in computer hardware, software, and networking have increased people’s ability to access information and reach economic potential. Internet applications change the way people use and share information. IT drives the innovative use of resources to promote new products, services, and ideas across the globe. The internet and the World Wide Web have transformed commerce, creating entirely new products and services, enhancing the way companies and their customers make transactions.

These advances in IT have spread quickly because they have progressively reduced the unit cost of computing power and transmissions. Smartphones and other handheld devices are preferred over personal computers.

In addition, the IT revolution is driving the extraordinarily rapid decrease in the cost and the rapid increase in the processing power of digital technologies. To keep up, technology firms seek skilled workers with not only knowledge of technology but also solid problem-solving abilities that give them an edge over the competition. Additionally, by dispersing offices globally, companies aim to recruit the best talent from different parts of the world. While technology accelerates globalization, globalization also accelerates developing technology.</div>

Define computer security, ethics, and privacy.

As Mei maintains multiple database applications in her medical office, she works with patient data, including name, age, address, and health condition. She also works with similar information about other employees. As the database administrator, Mei implements strong password policies. Mei has used multiple filters to prohibit access to certain websites, according to the Acceptable Use Policy. To monitor and secure the equipment, she installed cameras and card access to select rooms.

Mei takes courses on security and privacy to stay current with developments. It is her responsibility and professional commitment to make the IT infrastructure in her office as secure as possible given the IT budget her office has established.

Technology and Ethics

Questions about the impact of information technology are widespread and ever-present. With the release of new technologies and applications, more questions arise than we can answer or agree on.

Does information technology make society better or worse?
Is it acceptable to participate in a technical society without making an effort to understand information technology?
Do people who determine how technology will be supported or used have an obligation to understand technology?
To what extent should governments regulate information technology?
How do our decisions regarding technology affect future generations?
How should we change education to align with our ever-evolving technological society?
How can knowledge of an individual's activities tracked through technology be appropriately used while simultaneously ensuring it is not abused?

Consider having a discussion with a friend or colleague about one or more of these questions. Do you and your colleague agree? What other questions emerged from your discussion?

Legal, Ethical, and Regulatory Issues in the Computing Disciplines

Everyday computing has evolved rapidly, leading to both regulatory and social changes. Many computing laws are based on previous mindsets and physical considerations. Such laws fail to take into consideration the unique features of computing. For example, data has three primary stages: data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. When a crime occurs involving data, which country has the right to press charges—where the data was temporarily stored (data in use), where the server is located (data at rest), or the many locations the data passed through (data in transit)?

Advances in computing also affect ethics, challenging the traditional principles on which social behaviors are based. For example, do new applications represent new freedoms or new controls?

The difference between ethics and regulations is important when considering everyday computing. Regulations are requirements set by governing bodies and can result in penalties, fines, or even criminal charges. Alternatively, ethics are the morals that individuals and organizations abide by. For example, the ethics a person lives by determine whether that person takes lost money to its owner or puts it in their pocket. On the other hand, stealing money from a person’s pocket is illegal, or against the regulations, rather than against a person’s ethics.

Computing professionals and organizations must continuously consider their ethical and regulatory obligations; security, ownership, and liability; and social impact.

Ethics and Information Technology

Philosophers have taken many different approaches to ethics in their search for fundamental theories and principles to guide decisions and behaviors. Character-based ethics (also known as virtue ethics) argues that good behavior is not the result of applying identifiable rules (regulations), but is instead a natural consequence of good character. Other theories of ethics, such as consequence-based, duty-based, and contract-based, suggest that ethical dilemmas are resolved by considering consequences, duties, and contracts.

Character-based ethics is usually what is presented and discussed with professionals. Rather than reviewing specific ethical theories, they review case studies leading to a variety of ethical questions related to the professional's area of expertise. Discussing these case studies helps professionals become more aware of ethical issues.

Discuss the role of professional associations and ethics standards in the IT profession.

Do computer professionals have moral responsibilities? If so, what are they? Who is to blame when computer software failure causes harm? Is computer hacking immoral? Is it immoral to make unauthorized copies of software? Are you familiar with standards that already exist to govern ethics in IT? Consider making a list of the ethical principles an IT professional should follow. How does your list of ethical principles compare to the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics listed below?

Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics

Many ethical standards are already widely accepted throughout the world. One of the most notable is the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics, dating to the early 1950s.

Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics
Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid (without permission).
Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.
Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for other humans.

Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics

Laws of robotics are a set of laws, rules, or principles that are intended as a fundamental framework to underpin the behavior of robots designed to have a degree of autonomy. Robots with a high degree of complexity do not yet exist, but they have been widely anticipated in science fiction and films and are a topic of active research and development in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. The best known set of laws are those written by Isaac Asimov in the 1940s, or are based upon them, but other sets of laws have been proposed by researchers in the decades since then.

Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

Source: Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics

Science fiction? Yes, but take a look at the 2011 Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain's set of five ethical "principles for designers, builders and users or robots:"

Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.
Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.
It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot.</div>

<div class="content">Learning Objectives
Discuss the role of professional associations and ethics standards in the IT profession.
Identify the role of organizational culture in ethics.

Professional organizations support single disciplines through educational and informational missions. And as new disciplines emerge, so do supporting professional organizations. Their influence on professional organizations stems from the services provided to members. They publish professional journals, develop standards of professional ethics and excellence, and raise public awareness. Professional organizations, often referred to as societies, can be local, regional, national, and international.

Notable examples include the Association of Women in Computing and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, in addition to the others previously mentioned.

The Association for Women in Computing (opens new tab) (AWC) is dedicated to promoting the advancement of women in the computing professions.

The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (opens new tab) (AAAI) is devoted to advancing scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior, and their embodiment in machines.

Some organizations define quality standards for educational programs and institutions in the discipline. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (opens new tab) (ABET) certifies the quality of undergraduate educational programs in the computing science field based on criteria identified by ACM and IEEE.

Select one or two professional organizations from this section that interest you. Review their website and learn their structure, standards, and resources.

The Ethical Culture of an Organization

Organizational culture is defined by the expectations, experiences, philosophy, and values that guide employees’ behaviors. An organization’s culture is exhibited in the employees’ self-perceptions and interactions with others.

When working professionally, you may encounter situations where your personal ethics clash with the ethical culture of your company. An employee is expected to follow the organization’s ethical code of conduct. The ethical code of conduct is a written policy that assists employees in identifying ethical behaviors as defined by the organization.

A computing professional might be asked to develop IT policies. Policies such as an acceptable use policy (AUP) should reflect the organization’s ethics and provide clear guidelines. An acceptable use policy, detailing how computer systems owned by the organization can be used, should include the following aspects:

legal considerations, including data security laws, jurisdiction, the ownership of systems and data, and proper use of intellectual property
data security provisions, including personal responsibilities of users, ways the systems can and cannot be used, and types of unacceptable web content
liability considerations, outlining disclaimers that remove an organization’s responsibilities for data breaches, information theft, or misuse of the internet

Assume you are responsible for creating an acceptable use policy for the medical office. What guidelines would you include?</div>

Information privacy refers to the right to control how your personal information is collected, used, and exchanged. The discussion over privacy has intensified with massive data breaches, businesses selling personal data to other organizations, and targeted advertising abuse. While closely related, privacy and security are not the same. Security focuses on protecting data from unauthorized use and the exploitation of stolen data for profit. Privacy focuses on the use and governance of personal data, ensuring that it is collected, shared, and used appropriately.

Skim through “The 15 Biggest Data Breaches of the 21st Century (opens new tab)” and select a data breach to research. How were people affected by the data breach?

Professional organizations, such as the International Association of Privacy Professionals (opens new tab)(IAPP), help organizations design and apply appropriate approaches to privacy.

Computing professionals often handle sensitive data and information for both employees and clients. Additionally, data analysis may use data revealing organizational strategies for competitive advantage that need to be protected. Networking professionals may have insight into websites individuals access. Software developers may have access to strategic initiatives their software will support. All these situations raise ethical dilemmas. The ethical codes of an organization and professional organizations can help professionals resolve such ethical dilemmas.

In some cases, there may be a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is a situation in which a person has two relationships that might be incompatible with each other. For example, a person might have loyalty to an employer as well as loyalty to a family business. Each of these businesses expects the person to have its best interest first. Organizations should provide clear outlines on how to handle conflicts of interest.

Confidentiality
Figure. Confidentiality portion of the CIA Triad.

Confidentiality is a set of rules that limits access to data/information. Data is commonly categorized according to the amount and type of damage that could be done by unauthorized access. Implementing access controls is largely responsible for enforcing confidentiality.

Often, authorized users are given security training, supported by the computing professionals in the organization. Training typically includes how clients can identify and reduce security risks by doing the following:

Create strong password policies. Passwords should be at least eight characters combined with numbers and special characters. Passwords also need to be changed at least every three months, depending on the sensitivity of data on a given system.
Recognize social engineering attacks. Social engineering is a general term that describes any attack that takes advantage of humans' trusting nature. Phishing is one example of a method of capturing the victim’s valuable information (e.g., username and password, personally identifiable information) by sending emails that mimic real emails from businesses. These emails seemingly request that you reset the password for your account when in reality the attackers capture the victim’s input for their own use.

Integrity
Figure. Integrity portion of the CIA Triad.

Integrity is maintained when the data/information is both trustworthy and accurate. Data must not be changed in transit or be altered by unauthorized users. Methods for maintaining integrity include file permissions, user access controls, version control, and redundant systems or copies.

Availability
Figure. Availability portion of the CIA triad.

Availability refers to the ability to provide reliable access to the data/information for authorized individuals. Availability is best ensured by rigorously maintaining all hardware, testing compatibility with operating systems and installed applications, and keeping systems patched and up-to-date.

The elements of the confidentiality-integrity-availability (CIA) triad depend on each other. For example, if the confidentiality of data is emphasized, the integrity of data is less likely to be compromised. Organizations often make conscious compromises between the elements of the CIA triad when resources are limited, remaining vigilant about known risks.

Research more about the CIA triad. How is your organization implementing the CIA triad in its everyday processes?

Security is challenging for organizations with expanding volumes of data or those that are using emerging technologies. Big data, for example, poses security risks because of the volume of data and information that needs to be safeguarded, the multiple places these data are stored, and the different forms in which the data exist. The Internet of Things (IoT) also poses unique security challenges. For example, security can be an issue because of the number of connected hardware devices that are unpatched or configured with weak passwords.

In a recent demonstration, researchers showed that a network could be compromised through a Wi-Fi enabled (aka, "smart") light bulb.</div>

Identify the role of government regulations in ethics.

While enhancing the security of computer systems through regulations is typically effective and may deter some attacks, it does not prevent them. Also, because computer systems are used internationally, it can be difficult to obtain recourse. The United States and many other countries have federal laws governing computer security and privacy. For example, the United States' Security Breach Notification Laws govern the actions of a company in the case of data records being compromised, lost, or stolen. At the same time, laws that apply to various industries may impose obstacles on, or even restrict, implementation of new technologies. The legal landscape that applies to the work of computer personnel is large and complex.

What laws or regulations are in place in your country and industry? How do these compare to those established in the United States?

Information Technology Law Organizations and Resources
